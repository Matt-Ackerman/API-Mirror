(Source: CNN) \nBy KIRSTEN GRIESHABER and FERDINAND OSTROPAssociated Press \nMUENSTER, Germany (AP) - A van crashed into people drinking outside a popular bar Saturday in the German city of Muenster, killing two people and injuring 20 others before the driver of the vehicle shot and killed himself inside it, police said. \nA top German security official said there was no indication of an Islamic extremist motive but officials were investigating all possibilities in the deadly crash that took place at 3:27 p.m. on a warm spring day. \nWitnesses said people ran away screaming from the city square after the crash. Police quickly set up a large cordoned-off area for their investigation and ambulances rushed to the site. \nSix of the 20 injured were in severe condition, according to police spokesman Andreas Bode. \nHerbert Reul, the interior minister of North Rhine-Westphalia state, where Muenster is located, said the driver of the gray van was a German citizen. He stressed that the investigation was at an early stage but said \"at the moment, nothing speaks for there being any Islamist background.\" \n\"We have to wait, and we are investigating in all directions,\" Reul said, adding that it was clearly not an accident. \nReul said two people were killed in the crash and the driver killed himself - lower than the earlier police toll of three dead plus the driver. \nPolice spokesman Peter Nuessmeyer told The Associated Press that he could not confirm German media reports that the perpetrator reportedly had psychological issues. \nBode told reporters that police were checking witness reports that other perpetrators might have fled from the van at the scene. Hours later, police spokeswoman Vanessa Arlt said \"we didn't find anything (to those reports) but we're still investigating in all directions and not excluding anything.\" \nPolice tweeted that residents should \"avoid the area near the Kiepenkerl pub\" in the city's historic downtown area where a large-scale police operation was underway. \nPolice also said they found a suspicious object in the van that they were examining to see if it was dangerous. They told German news agency dpa that was the reason authorities cordoned off such a large area. \nThe Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper said the suspect's apartment was being searched Saturday night for possible explosives. \nThe Muenster University Hospital put out an urgent call for citizens to donate blood - and so many people rushed to help that long lines of donors formed. Jan Schoessler, who was among those in line, said dozens of people were waiting shortly after doors opened at 7 p.m. \nThe university cancelled the call after only an hour and thanked everyone on Twitter \"for your overwhelming support.\" \nMuenster, a major university city, has about 300,000 residents and an attractive medieval city center that was rebuilt after World War II. TV footage showed a narrow street sealed off Saturday with red-and-white police tape. Dozens of ambulances were near the cordoned-off area and helicopters were flying overhead. \nThe Kiepenkerl is not only one of the city's best-known traditional pubs, but also the emblem of the city, depicting a traveling salesman with a long pipe in his mouth and a big backpack on his back. \nUgur Hur was working at a nearby cafe in downtown Muenster when the crash took place. \n\"I heard a loud bang, screaming. And the police arrived and everyone was sent out,\" he said. \"A lot of people were running away screaming.\" \nLino Baldi, who owns an Italian restaurant near the scene of the crash, told Sky TG24 that the city center had been packed with people out enjoying a Saturday market and summer-like temperatures, which had risen to 25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit) from just 12 degrees (54 degrees F) a day earlier. \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said she was \"deeply shocked by the terrible events in Muenster.\" \n\"Everything conceivable is being done to investigate the crime and to support the victims and their relatives,\" Merkel said in a statement. \"My thanks go to all the responders at the scene.\" \n___ \nGrieshaber reported from Berlin.

      "text": "Quintuplets born at Phoenix hospital are 'angels' 2018-04-06T22:07:55Z \nBy MELISSA DANIELSAssociated Press \nPHOENIX (AP) - Bringing five babies into the world has left Jamie Scott feeling tired, excited and ultimately blessed. \nShe delivered quintuplets by Caesarean section after 29 weeks of pregnancy on March 21 at Dignity Health St. Joseph Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix. \n\"I feel so blessed when I look at each of their little faces, and each of their little souls I can feel,\" she said. \nShe and her husband Skyler Scott temporarily moved from Utah to Phoenix in December to get care at St. Joseph's. The hospital, in partnership with the Elliott Center for Multiples, is a go-to facility for pregnancies with high-order multiples, or triplets or more. \nThe new Scott children include three girls -Violet, Daisy, Lily - and two boys, Logan and Lincoln. All were born weighing less than three pounds. \nThe babies are doing well; no one needs a breathing tube or is on antibiotics, said Dr. Vinit Manuel, who is the medical director of what St. Joseph's calls its Nursery Intensive Care Unit. He said they'll likely spend the next five to six weeks in the hospital. \nThe Scotts amassed more than 53,000 Facebook followers and more than 35,000 Instagram followers during the pregnancy. Speaking to the media on Friday, the Scotts praised their health care team. Jamie Scott required eight weeks of bed rest. \n\"They really made it so bearable and wonderful,\" Skyler Scott said. \"And I really believe that some of the best, most angelic people in the world somehow find their way into the NICU.\" \nThe Scotts have a 12-year-old son, Shayden and a 7-year-old son Landon. They learned they were welcoming quintuplets after struggling to get pregnant for a third baby and seeing a fertility specialist. When they learned they were expecting five babies, they \"researched like crazy\" to find the best care, Jamie Scott said. \nThe high-risk pregnancy saw complications; at 21 weeks, the sac surrounding one of the babies ruptured. But it eventually began to heal itself, something Dr. John Elliott said he hadn't seen before in a quintuplet pregnancy. \nThroughout the pregnancy, Jamie Scott gained 73 pounds - just shy of a 75-pound goal - while consuming around 4,000 calories a day. Elliott wanted to deliver the babies at 34 weeks, but a 29-week delivery was still longer than the national average of less than 27 weeks for quintuplets, Elliott said. \nMuch of the journey was shared on their Facebook and Instagram pages, dubbed \"Five Two Love\" as a nod to the \"scquints\" and their two sons. At first, Jamie Scott was hesitant to share details of her pregnancy publicly. \n\"The messages of love and hope that we've received from around the world have really helped strengthen us to get through this tough time of very, very high risk pregnancy,\" she said. \nThe Scotts plan to return to their community in St. George, Utah, once the babies and mom are healthy enough to travel. A GoFundMe account set up for the family has raised more than $25,000 in two months. \nFor now, the Scotts are focused on keeping the babies fed, with mom pumping breastmilk every three hours, and looking forward to getting their family of nine under one roof. \n\"I'm excited,\" she said. \"I'm very, very tired right now, but I know with doing this it's gonna take the two of us and a whole village of people back home.\" Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

(AP) - Tiger Woods was trying to figure out how to get to the 17th green from closer to the 15th fairway when the massive gallery anticipating his shot heard a huge roar behind them that caused them to look over their shoulders. \nRickie Fowler was responsible for making all that noise with an eagle on the second hole. \nThe third round of the Masters was just getting started on Saturday. The player so many fans wanted to see was about done. \nNeeding something special to even have hope, Woods had to settle for ordinary. \nA few sloppy bogeys, two of them on par 5s. A few birdies. It added to an even-par 72, his best score of the week. \n\"I'm not hitting it close enough. I'm not taking advantage of the par 5s and consequently a good round is even par,\" Woods said. \nIt was disappointing, sure, but it also was surprising. \nWoods spent so much of the Florida swing of the PGA Tour piecing his game back together, and his iron game was particularly sharp. And then at the Masters, it wasn't. Woods said he knows what the problem is, he just can't fix it. \nAnd now it's too late for him to do anything about it. \nSo instead of Woods capping off this comeback with a fifth green jacket, he had to settle for playing the Masters for the first time in three years. Regardless of the score, no one wanted to miss him. Fans packed into Amen Corner and celebrated with Woods when he hit the green after two days of going into Rae's Creek. This one settled 8 feet away from the left pin. \n\"I just couldn't do it three days in a row,\" Woods said. \"Missed the putt. But hey, that's a lot easier to play the hole from the green than it is dropping.\" \nThey stood on their toes - some of them hopped in place - to try to see over all the heads lining the 13th fairway to check if his shot cleared the tributary in front of the green. It narrowly did, except that Woods then chipped it too close to the edge and off the back of the green. \nIt wasn't great golf. It was simply golf by one of the greatest players. \nWoods was assured of moving back into the top 100 in the world, notable only because he was at No. 1,199 just over four months ago when he returned from yet another long layoff following multiple back surgeries. \n\"I've had some success in this comeback, and I'm getting there,\" Woods said. \"I wish this week would have been a little bit better. Hopefully, tomorrow I can shoot something, get me to even par or even in the red. I think that will be a good goal tomorrow and hopefully I can get it done.\" \nFor now, all that can be said about this comeback is that he's at least back. \nWoods played the third round with Ian Poulter - they had not played together in a tournament since the Bridgestone Invitational in 2011. Poulter said as they walked up the 18th fairway, he said to Woods, \"It's good to see you healthy again.\" \nIt wasn't always like that. \n\"It would have felt different 15 years ago than it did today,\" Poulter said. \"I would have been more nervous. It would have been more intimidating. He would have been hard, with his game face on.\" \nHe described Woods now as having a softer personality, and Poulter isn't alone in sensing that. \nWoods is 1 under for the week on the four par 5s. He went just over the back of the 15th green with a wedge, chipped only up to the putting surface and missed his par putt. It was an example of how loose his game has been all week. \n\"It's been scratchy this week,\" he said. \"I just haven't gotten it done. I feel like I'm driving it better than I have all year, but I am not capitalizing on it. And when I did miss I missed in the wrong spots. My swing is just off with my irons, just at the wrong time.\" Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

A junior hockey team, the Humboldt Broncos, was headed to a playoff game Friday afternoon when a truck collided with its bus. Among the dead were the team's coach and captain. \n\"It's got to rip the heart out of your chest,\" Babcock, who grew up in Saskatoon, said at Air Canada Centre. \"We pray for those families and think about them. Horrific, horrific accident.\" \nAdded NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman: \"The NHL mourns the passing of those who perished and offers strength and comfort to those injured while traveling to play and be part of a game they all love.\" \nToronto center Tyler Bozak said he had difficulty sleeping after hearing the news about the crash near Nipawin. \n\"You can't really put into words, anything,\" Bozak said before Saturday's regular-season finale against the Montreal Canadiens. \"I can't imagine what everyone's going through back in Saskatchewan.\" \nColorado Avalanche coach Jared Bednar grew up in Humboldt. He said a friend's son plays goaltender for the Broncos and survived the crash. \n\"He went to surgery last night in Saskatoon, and hopefully he's doing better,\" Bednar said from Denver. \"It's a tough time for that town. It's a tight-knit community. It's only 6,000 people.\" \nFormer NHL player Sheldon Kennedy well understands the \"state of shock and confusion\" people are feeling. Kennedy was involved in a crash in 1986 that killed four players when a bus carrying the Swift Current Broncos hit a patch of ice and crashed. \n\"I think one thing that we underestimate with the impact of trauma and PTSD and going through things like this is the magnitude of the impact,\" he said. \"That is what I can't stress enough.\" \nPatrick Marleau of the Toronto Maple Leafs was a boy in Saskatchewan when the Swift Current crash happened. \n\"It's something you remember when you're that young,\" he said. \"You see the players wearing the logo on their jersey for the players that were lost. It definitely hits home. Growing up around Swift Current, it was always in people's mind. There's memorials. They're never forgotten.\" \nBabcock has driven the stretch of two-lane highway north of Tisdale where the team was heading to play Game 5 of a semifinal against the Nipawin Hawks. \n\"I know that road pretty good,\" he said. \"It didn't seem like a big spot, it's not mountains or anything like that, but accidents do happen.\" \nMarleau knows the hold the game has in his country, and how \"hockey is everything in Canada.\" \n\"But in Saskatchewan, every community's fairly small,\" he said. \"So everybody knows everybody and you try and look out for each other and take care of each other.\" \n___ \nThe Canadian Press and AP Sports Writer Pat Graham in Denver contributed to this report.

(Source: AP Photos) \nNIPAWIN, Saskatchewan (AP) - A semi-trailer slammed into a bus carrying a youth hockey team in western Canada, killing 15 people and injuring 14 in a catastrophic collision that a doctor compared to an airstrike and left the vehicles obliterated in the snow. The crash sent shockwaves through the team's small hometown and a country united by the national sport. \nCanadians were moved to tears on Saturday as they learned of the identities of the deceased on the bus that was driving the Humboldt Broncos hockey team to a crucial playoff game Friday against the Nipawin Hawks. \n\"An entire country is in shock and mourning,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. \"This is every parent's worst nightmare. No one should ever have to see their child leave to play the sport they love and never come back.\" \nThe bus had 29 passengers, including the driver, when it crashed at about 5 p.m. on Highway 35, police said. Among the dead are Broncos head coach Darcy Haugan, team captain Logan Schatz and radio announcer Tyler Bieber. Authorities earlier said three were in critical but later provided an update to say that 15 have now died. \nCanadian police said the truck driver was initially detained but has since been released and provided with mental health assistance. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said it's too early to state a cause for the crash. \nIn a tweet, U.S. President Donald Trump said he called Trudeau to offer his condolences to the families of victims. \nDarren Opp, president of the Nipawin Hawks, who the Broncos were set to play against, said a semi T-boned the players' bus - an account police confirmed. \n\"It's a horrible accident, my God,\" Opp said. \nHassan Masri, an emergency room doctor at Saskatoon's Royal University Hospital who has done work in war-torn Syria, said the crash reminded him of an airstrike. Photographs of the wreckage showed the twisted trailer with most of its wheels in the air and the bus on its side and its back portion destroyed. \nKelly Schatz, Logan's father, says his 20-year-old son played for the Broncos for just over four years and had served as team captain for the past 2 ½ years. Meanwhile, tributes poured in online for coach Haugan, a father of two who was described as an amazing mentor to young players. \nThe names of others killed have not been confirmed. STARS air ambulance said it sent three helicopters to the scene. \nThe tragedy brought to mind an accident in 1986, when the Swift Current Broncos team bus slid off an icy highway and crashed in late December, killing four players. \nThe Humboldt Broncos are a close-knit team from the small city of Humboldt, Saskatchewan, which has a population of about 6,000. Many gathered at the community center at the hockey arena there after word of the horrific crash began to circulate. \nHumboldt Mayor Rob Muench, wearing a green and yellow Broncos team jersey, hugged people Saturday morning as they came to the Elger Petersen Arena in the Saskatchewan town to comfort each other and learn more. \n\"It's overwhelming. It's been tough on everybody,\" Muench said in a phone interview. \"We're a small community; some of those kids have been on the team for a number of years. A lot grew up in the community and everybody knows each other.\" \nThe team was on its way to play in Game 5 of a semi-final against the Nipawin Hawks. \n\"Hockey was what brought us all together and we had two communities that were rivals in the rink. To find out that it was their first responders that aided our boys just warms your heart,\" the mayor said as his voice cracked. \nMultiple crisis workers were assisting relatives and friends. \n\"Everybody is just so devastated. These poor young boys,\" said Penny Lee, the communications manager for the town of Humboldt. \nThe Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League is a junior 'A' hockey league under Hockey Canada, which is part of the Canadian Junior Hockey League. It's open to North American-born players between the ages of 16 and 20. \nTeam President Kevin Garinger said parents from across western Canada were struggling to cope with the tragedy and were rushing to the scene. \n\"Our whole community is in shock, we are grieving and we will continue to grieve throughout this ordeal as we try to work toward supporting each other,\" he said. \nMichelle Straschnitzki, who lives in Airdrie, Alberta, said her 18-year old son Ryan was transported to a hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. \n\"We talked to him, but he said he couldn't feel his lower extremities so I don't know what's going on,\" she said. \"I am freaking out. I am so sad for all of the teammates and I am losing my mind.\" \nGaringer said he still didn't know the fate of one of the players living in his home. \n\"We just need to try to support each other as we deal with this incredible loss to our community, to our province, to our hockey world.\" \nKevin Henry, a coach who runs a hockey school in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, said he knows players on the team. \n\"This is I would think one of the darkest days in the history of Saskatchewan, especially because hockey is so ingrained in how we grow up here,\" he said. \nMuch of the hockey world issued messages of condolences, including Saskatchewan native Mike Babcock, who is the Toronto Maple Leafs coach. \nBabcock, fighting back tears, said that \"it's got to rip the heart out of your chest.\" \n___ \nRob Gillies contributed to this report from Toronto and Ivan Moreno contributed from Milwaukee.

Marc Leishman, of Australia, shoots around a tree on the 17th hole during the second round at the Masters golf tournament Friday, April 6, 2018, in Augusta, Ga. \nAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - The Latest on Saturday's third round at the Masters (all times local): \n5:20 p.m. \nPatrick Reed's birdies keep coming in bunches. \nReed responded in a huge way to Rory McIlroy's eagle at the par-5 eighth by making three straight birdies in the third round at Augusta National on Saturday. He posted red numbers on Nos. 8, 9 and 10, and headed to Amen Corner with a three-stroke lead. \nIt's the fifth time in 46 holes that Reed strung together back-to-back-to-back birds. The 27-year-old Texan is seeking his first victory at a major championship. \nReed gave one shot back when he flew the green at the par-3 12th and barely missed an 11-footer for par amid a sudden downpour. \n___ \n4:45 p.m. \nPhil Mickelson found a silver lining - crystal, really - in the third round at the Masters. \nMickelson shot a 2-over 74 Saturday thanks partly to making a triple bogey and a bogey on the first two holes. He is at 7-over 223 heading into the final 18 holes Sunday. \nThe highlight of the third round will be making an eagle at the par-5 eighth. It was the 19th eagle of his career at the Masters, and each one comes with a commemorative crystal glass. \nMickelson says \"it wasn't a total loss\" and adds \"you can never have enough crystal.\" \nIt might even help him forget about the first few holes, specifically the shot in which completely missed the ball trying to get back to the fairway. He punched out, missed the green and wound up with a triple bogey. \n___ \n4:15 p.m. \nThere's a new name near the top of the leaderboard at the Masters. \nRory McIlroy chipped in for an eagle at the par-5 eighth in the third round at Augusta National and briefly tied 36-hole leader Patrick Reed at 9 under. McIlroy responded with a dramatic fist pump while biting his bottom lip. \nReed made a birdie on the same hole a few minutes later and reached 10 under. \nMcIlroy was about 20 yards right of the green with his second shot and delivered a nearly perfect chip that bounced a few feet short of the green and starting tracking toward the pin. The shot would have rolled well past the hole, but it hit the stick and dropped in for a 3. \nIt could end up being the shot of the day. \n___ \n4:05 p.m. \nPaul Casey credited his best round of the week at the Masters to a marker and a mattress. \nCasey shot a 3-under 69 in the third round Saturday and made a decent move up the leaderboard. He was in the first group off the tee and played alongside Augusta National club champion Jeff Knox, who typically fills in when an odd number of players make the cut at the Masters. \nThey played in 3 ½ hours, about two hours fasters than threesomes averages during the first two rounds, and Casey called it \"the best experience I've ever had with a marker.\" \nCasey found one more reason for his improved play: He slept in his 3-year-old son's bed the last few nights in hopes of loosening up a tight hip. \nCasey didn't like the mattress in the house he rented near the course, so he bunked with his kid in \"a proper bed.\" \n___ \n3:15 p.m. \nTiger Woods is making a move - in the world rankings, not the Masters leaderboard. \nWoods is expected to crack the top 100 for the first time in years following golf's first major. \nWoods shot an even-par 72 in the third round Saturday at Augusta National and is at 4-over 220 through three rounds. He continued to struggle with iron play, failing to get a grip on distance control. \nHe says \"my swing is just off with my irons.\" \nThe 42-year-old Woods is playing the Masters for the first time since 2015. He is back following a fourth back surgery. \nHe started the week ranked No. 103 in the world, but should move up several spots after making the cut at golf's first major. \nWoods says he is \"just kind of gradually working on it, gradually building,\" adding, \"I'm getting there.\" \nWoods won't win a fifth green jacket and says he now has a modest goal for the final round: \"Even par or even in the red. Hopefully, I can get it done.\" \n___ \n2:55 p.m. \nMatthew Fitzpatrick made a huge move on \"Moving Day\" at the Masters. \nThe 23-year-old Englishman shot a 5-under 67 in the third round Saturday at Augusta National, getting to even-par 216 for the tournament. He's surely to make one of the biggest jumps - maybe even the biggest - heading into the final round. \nFitzpatrick made four birdies and an eagle - all in a nine-hole stretch - to surge up the leaderboard. \nFitzpatrick, who has four wins on the European Tour, is in the Masters for the fourth consecutive year. He first made the tournament after winning the U.S. Amateur in 2013 and making the field the following year. He missed the cut. \nHe tied for seventh in 2016. \nUmbrellas were out early at the golf course with light, intermittent rain falling. Play has not been stopped though the forecast calls for steady showers all day. \n___ \n12:05 p.m. \nWhat will Phil do next? A little bit of everything. \nPhil Mickelson began the third round with a drive into the trees, and then he completely missed the ball trying to get back to the fairway. He punched out, missed the green and wound up with a triple bogey. He followed that with a bogey. \nAnd then on the par-5 eighth, Mickelson hit driver off the fairway to 8 feet and made eagle. He's tied for last place. He's no less entertaining. \nTiger Woods, meanwhile, made his first birdie on the par-3 sixth. He was 1 over for his round. Woods opened with 73-75. He has never had three consecutive rounds over par at any Masters, even as an amateur. \n___ \n10:45 a.m. \nTiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have begun their third rounds at the Masters and the umbrellas are out at Augusta National. \nThey were playing in a light rain and the forecast calls for steady showers all day. \nMickelson triple-bogeyed the first hole, his second triple of the tournament. Mickelson, who was playing the third round with Tyrrell Hatton, tripled No. 9 on Friday. \nWoods bogeyed the first hole. \nPatrick Reed leads the tournament at 6 under and is scheduled to tee off at 2:30. \n___ \n4:35 a.m. \nPatrick Reed is halfway home to his first major championship. \nHe got there by mostly staying out of trouble at daunting Augusta National and mastering the four par 5s. \nReed shot a 6-under 66 in the second round Friday and moved to 9-under 135 for the tournament. He takes a two-shot lead over Marc Leishman into Saturday's third round, which could be affected by rain. \nForecasts call for steady showers all day, the kind of weather that should soften up what had become a hard and fast test. \nThe way Reed has played, it's doubtful even Mother Nature can slow him down. \n\"I believe if I play the golf I know how to play, I can win majors,\" said Reed, a 27-year-old Texan who ended his college career 3 miles down the road at Augusta State. \"I need to stick to my game plan.\" \nReed and Leishman will be the final pairing Saturday, scheduled to tee off at 2:30 p.m. \n___ \nFor more AP golf coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Golf and https://apnews.com/tag/TheMasters Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Devils, Blue Jackets sit top players for rest in Game 82 - KFVS12 News & Weather Cape Girardeau, Carbondale, Poplar Bluff Member Center: Devils, Blue Jackets sit top players for rest in Game 82 2018-04-07T19:07:56Z \nBy STEPHEN WHYNOAP Hockey Writer \nBeing healthy in the playoffs is taking priority over seeding, with a few teams sitting their top players Saturday in the final game of the regular season. \nMVP front-runner Taylor Hall will sit out the New Jersey Devils' regular-season finale after the team clinched a playoff spot but can still move up the standings. \nNew Jersey is resting Hall, fellow forwards Kyle Palmieri and Travis Zajac, and defenseman Sami Vatanen in Game 82 at Washington, and it isn't alone in taking precautions. The Columbus Blue Jackets won't play stars Artemi Panarin, Seth Jones, Zach Werenski and two-time Vezina Trophy-winning goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky in their final regular-season game at Nashville. \nColumbus coach John Tortorella told reporters he was \"absolutely not\" trying to avoid facing the two-time defending Stanley Cup-champion Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round. New Jersey coach John Hynes similarly answered that giving Hall a break is more important after a grueling push to clinch the franchise's first playoff berth since 2012. \n\"We're not looking to get in the playoffs and just be a Cinderella story,\" Hynes said before his Devils faced the Metropolitan Division-champion Capitals on Saturday night. \"We're looking to get in the playoffs and win, and (Hall is) a big part of that.\" \nHall, who is one goal short of reaching 40 for the first time in his career, said he's cool with the decision to rest instead of taking a chance on the eve of the playoffs. \n\"It's a good time to get some rest and recuperate a little bit,\" said Hall, who has 93 points in 76 games and is expected to be a finalist for the Hart Trophy. \"We've played a lot of hockey lately, and a lot of the stuff in the standings is out of our hands other than our game.\" \nNo Eastern Conference first-round matchups have been determined going into the final weekend of the season. The only series that's set is the Winnipeg Jets facing the Minnesota Wild out West as the second- and third-place teams in the Central Division. \nThere are still numerous combinations of matchups among the seven teams in the East that have clinched, with the Philadelphia Flyers and Florida Panthers still in the running for the final spot. Matchups can make a big difference in how the playoffs go, but players and coaches are careful not to look like they're favoring one opponent over another. \n\"I learned a long time ago that you don't wish for certain opponents,\" Devils defenseman Ben Lovejoy said. \"It can backfire very quickly.\" \nThe Tampa Bay Lightning certainly aren't playing that game. With a chance to clinch first place in the Atlantic Division and avoid facing the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round, the Lightning are expected to start backup Louis Domingue in net at Carolina instead of Andrei Vasilevskiy, who leads the NHL in wins. \nThe Boston Bruins, who could catch the Lightning, are going with backup Anton Khudobin against Ottawa, but they also play Sunday night against Florida in a game that was rescheduled because of snow. \n___ \nFollow Hockey Writer Stephen Whyno on Twitter at https://twitter.com/SWhyno \n___ \nMore NHL hockey: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Messi nets 3, Barca equals Liga record of 38 games unbeaten - KFVS12 News & Weather Cape Girardeau, Carbondale, Poplar Bluff Member Center: Messi nets 3, Barca equals Liga record of 38 games unbeaten 2018-04-07T18:50:12Z \nBy JOSEPH WILSONAssociated Press \nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) - Lionel Messi scored a hat trick and ensured Barcelona equaled a Spanish league record of 38 matches without a loss after beating Leganes 3-1 on Saturday. \nBarcelona matched Real Sociedad's milestone set in 1979-80 by remaining undefeated through 31 rounds this season after finishing the last campaign without a loss over the final seven games. The runaway leader hasn't lost in La Liga in a year. \nErnesto Valverde's side can establish a new unbeaten record if it doesn't lose to Valencia next weekend. It will then have another six rounds left in its quest to finish the entire campaign without a defeat. \n\"This is one of those records that goes down in history,\" Valverde said. \"I am excited to have matched it because of what it means, and what it meant at that time for Real (Sociedad). Over time you realize its importance.\" \nReaching the mark set by Sociedad underscores the exceptional job Valverde is doing in his first year with the team. Despite having Messi and other top players, Barcelona entered the season reeling from the unwanted departure of star striker Neymar and back-to-back losses to Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup. \nEight months later and Barcelona is marching toward the recovery of the Liga title from Madrid. It opened a 12-point lead over second-place Atletico Madrid before it faces third-place Madrid in a derby on Sunday. \n___ \nMORE MESSI MAGIC \nMessi scored from a free kick for the seventh time this season before completing his third league hat trick in 2017-18. \nThe Argentina forward earned a foul from Leganes defender Dimitrios Siovas a few meters outside the top of the area, to the right. It was a perfect spot for him to curl a left-footed strike high beyond the reach of diving goalkeeper Ivan Cuellar. \nMessi followed up on his 27th-minute opener with a second goal five minutes later, slotting a low strike in after Coutinho met his run into the box. \nBarcelona paid for its complacency in the second half when Leganes forward Nabil El Zhar stuck on a counterattack in the 68th, after his shot grazed Sergi Roberto beat goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen. \nMessi flipped his third goal over Cuellar after receiving a pass from Ousmane Dembele in the 87th. \nThe treble took Messi's league-leading tally to 29. \nRoberto, who has already shown his versatility playing as a midfielder, right back, or forward, added to his repertoire by playing his first match at left back for Barcelona. That let Jordi Alba rest until he went on as a late substitute along with Andres Iniesta. \nSergio Busquets and Samuel Umtiti also rested ahead of Barcelona's return-leg Champions League quarterfinal at Roma on Tuesday. Barcelona won the first leg 4-1. \n___ \nSEVILLA SLUMPS \nSevilla was routed at Celta Vigo 4-0 four days before it must attempt a comeback at Bayern Munich to reach its first Champions League semifinals. \nSpain striker Iago Aspas scored a hat trick to take his season tally to 18. Only Messi, and Luis Suarez and Cristiano Ronaldo who each have 22, have scored more. \nCelta's opener and Aspas' strike to complete the demolition went in off defender Guilherme Arana. \nSevilla also conceded two that deflected in off its players in a 2-1 loss to Bayern on Tuesday in the opening leg of their Champions League quarterfinal. \nCoach Vicenzo Montella must quickly regroup his team for Wednesday's trip to Munich. \n\"We are angry. We didn't respond and we have to find solutions,\" Montella said. \nNinth-place Celta moved to within three points of Sevilla in seventh. \n___ \nBETIS INTO FIFTH \nReal Betis continued to impress by beating Eibar 2-0 at home, securing a fourth consecutive win to move ahead of Villarreal into fifth place. \nAlaves overcame Getafe 2-1 at home for its first win in five rounds.

(AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez). Kevin Harvick walks through the garage area as members of his team make adjustments to his car after a practice session for a NASCAR Cup series auto race in Fort Worth, Texas, Saturday, April 6, 2018. \nBy STEPHEN HAWKINSAP Sports Writer \nFORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - Kurt Busch is on the pole, Clint Bowyer is coming off his first victory in six years and Kevin Harvick has won half of the races so far on the NASCAR Cup Series schedule. \nAric Almirola, the newcomer to the team, has been steady, too, finishing 14th or better in every race. \nWith Stewart-Haas Racing already off to a sensational start this season, the decade-old team will now have the top three starters in a race for the first time Sunday. Busch, Harvick and Bowyer qualified their Fords 1-2-3 at Texas Motor Speedway, while Almirola was 12th at the 1½-mile track. \n\"We unloaded off the truck here and went right back to the top of the board. That is pretty cool,\" said Bowyer, whose victory at Martinsville before the Easter break ended his 190-race winless streak. \n\"It is crazy how you can get your cars with a good balance on them and really roll them through the corners good,\" he said. \"It seems if they are fast at one track they are going to be fast at the next.\" \nAll four Stewart-Haas cars are in the top 11 in season points through the first six races. Harvick is seventh, followed by Bowyer at eighth, Busch 10th and Almirola 11th. \nHendrick Motorsports also has all four of its drivers in the top 20. But Alex Bowman, Jimmie Johnson, Chase Elliott and William Byron are all below the Stewart-Haas drivers in the standings. \nBusch is the first three-time Cup pole sitter in Texas, where he and Harvick will make their track-record 31st starts. TMS, which opened in 1997, is hosting its 35th race. Both have one win there. \nWhen asked why Stewart-Haas is having so much success this season, Busch was admittedly biased in his assessment. Tony Gibson, his former crew chief including for the 2017 Daytona 500 win, is now off the road in what the driver calls \"a perfect role\" for Gibson, who is involved in building the cars for all four teams. \n\"If you go ask him now, he will say it is all about the people and process around him,\" Busch said. \"But he has found some good people, rearranged them into different positions and I think that our team is doing a really good job of creating continuity between the four cars.\" \nHarvick won at Texas last November, and this season has won the only two races on 1½-mile tracks , at Atlanta and Las Vegas, during his three-race winning streak. \nThis is only Stewart-Haas Racing's second season with Ford, after the team switched from Chevrolet. \n\"When you see what Stewart-Haas Racing has done with Ford, we still haven't reached the potential of where we can be,\" Harvick said. \"We have, in my opinion, the most stable team in the garage. When you have the most stable team in the garage from a financial standpoint and manufacturer standpoint, that attracts good people. ... We are the drivers lucky enough to be in a position of where Stewart-Haas racing is right now. We have a very solid foundation.\" \nThree-time Cup champion Tony Stewart was still driving with Joe Gibbs Racing in 2008 when he announced he would join forces with Cup owner Gene Haas to form Stewart-Haas Racing. The team made its debut in 2009 and is in its 10th season, marking 1,000 starts in the top series when all four drivers take the green flag in Texas. \nBowyer describes the team as feeling like family and at ease. He believes Stewart-Haas is even more stable now than it was when he joined last year. \n\"Everybody had the confidence in a champion going over there,\" Bowyer said, when asked if that stability was a credit to Stewart. \"You can't leave out the boss, Gene Haas. Everybody knows that he steps up whenever needed. The conversation with Gene is: 'When are you going to win? How are going to win? What do you need to win more?' It's never anything about anything other than that.\" \n___ \nMore AP auto racing: www.racing.ap.org   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

(AP Photo/Tom Mihalek). Philadelphia Flyers' Brian Elliott defends the goal as New York Rangers' Steven Fogarty attacks during the first period of an NHL hockey game Saturday, April 7, 2018 in Philadelphia, PA. \nBy AARON BRACYAssociated Press \nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - Claude Giroux earned his first career hat trick in the regular season and the Philadelphia Flyers clinched a playoff berth in their final regular-season game with a 5-0 victory over the New York Rangers on Saturday. \nGiroux finished with 34 goals and 102 points. He extended his career highs in points and goals while becoming the sixth player in franchise history to reach 100 points in a season. \nMichael Raffl and Ivan Provorov also scored for the Flyers, who needed at least one point to make the playoffs and eliminate the Florida Panthers from postseason contention. \nThe Flyers (42-26-14) are returning to the playoffs for the first time since 2016, and will be vying for their third Stanley Cup. The club won back-to-back titles in 1973-74 and 1974-75. \nThe Flyers' captain scored his first two goals during Philadelphia's dominating second period in which it outscored the Rangers 3-0 thanks in part to an 18-5 shots advantage. \nGiroux put the Flyers ahead 2-0 with 7:36 left in the second when his shot from the left circle got through Henrik Lundqvist's legs after a screen by Nolan Patrick. \nRaffl made it a three-goal lead when he took the rebound of Radko Gudas' shot from the point with a turnaround shot that got past Lundqvist's right pad with 2:07 left in the period. \nAnd Philadelphia set a club record for the quickest two goals when Giroux fired past Lundqvist's glove side with a wrist shot from the slot just 6 seconds after Raffl's tally to make it 4-0. Raffl set up the play by intercepting a Rangers pass at the blue line and dropping a pass to Giroux. \nThe fans unleashed a thunderous \"M-V-P!\" ''M-V-P!\" chant for Giroux when he was shown on the video board. \nAnd Giroux had the sold-out crowd of 20,028 in a frenzy when he scored his third on a breakaway with 9:49 left in the third period. Hundreds of hats littered the ice, causing a seven-minute delay, and Giroux smiled on the video board and waved to the crowd, which gave him a standing ovation. \nThe Rangers (34-39-9), who are out of the postseason for the first time since 2009-10, ended their regular season with their ninth loss in the last 11. \nBrian Elliott made 17 saves in his second game in goal after returning in Thursday's 4-3 win over Carolina following a 25-game absence because of core muscle surgery on Feb. 13. \nElliott was shaky in the win over the Hurricanes, allowing a pair of soft goals while making 19 saves. He didn't have much action against the Rangers. \nProvorov got the Flyers on the board 6½ minutes into the game when he scored on a 6-on-5 advantage as a result of a delayed penalty. Sean Couturier sent the puck toward the crease from the left of the goal, and the puck caromed off Provorov's right shoulder and past Lundqvist. The goal stood after an officials' review. \nNOTES: D Brady Skjei is the only Rangers player to appear in every game this season. Four Flyers: Couturier, Provorov, Giroux and Jakub Voracek, accomplished the feat for Philadelphia. ... Eric Lindros was the previous Flyers player to reach 100 points, with 115 in the 1995-96 season. . LW Matt Beleskey, acquired in the trade that sent Rick Nash to the Bruins on Feb. 25, made his Rangers debut and C Steven Fogarty made his NHL debut for New York. \nUP NEXT \nRangers: End of regular season \nFlyers: First-round playoff series. \n___ \nMore NHL hockey: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

      "text": "Border towns react to possible troop deployment Posted: Updated: As President Trump considers deploying between 2,000 and 4,000 National Guard troops to the US-Mexican border, residents and law enforcement officials in border towns say they have mixed feelings about the news. By Dakin Andone, Ed Lavandera and Gary Tuchman CNN \n(CNN) -- As President Donald Trump considers deploying between 2,000 and 4,000 National Guard troops to the US-Mexican border, residents and law enforcement officials in border towns say they have mixed feelings about the news. \nWhile some welcome the support from the federal government, others feel it's a waste of resources. \nHere's what some of them told CNN. \n'We have enough authority in town' \nEach night, citizen journalist Priscilla Villarreal takes to the streets of Laredo, Texas, to livestream footage of car accidents and crime scenes over Facebook. \nAs a woman who's familiar with her community -- and the dark underbelly that sometimes rears its head in the late hours -- she's confident sending more troops to the border is futile. \n\"In all honesty, I don't think sending extra security to our borders is going to solve anything,\" Villarreal, also known as \"LaGordiloca,\" told CNN against the backdrop of flashing police lights. She was at the scene of a car crash, and the vehicle, she said, had been carrying undocumented immigrants. It's common sight in Laredo, Villarreal said. \nTrump said Thursday he was considering sending the National Guard to assist in border security, a move that would be in line with actions taken by both of his predecessors. \nHis comments come as a caravan of migrants makes its way through Central America, with some bound for the US border. \n\"We're used to all this,\" Villarreal said, before stressing she's never felt unsafe in Laredo, which she called a \"tightknit community.\" \nVillarreal said she believes local law enforcement agencies and the US Border Patrol can handle whatever immigrants are crossing the border. \"We have enough authority in town to cover whatever's happening in our town,\" she said. \nTrump's announcement has gotten the attention of many Laredo residents, Villarreal said. Some think an influx of troops won't bring change to the city and believe it's a waste of federal money. But she added, \"There's a lot of Trump supporters in Laredo that disagree.\" \n'A lawless border' \nHector Garza, a spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council union near Laredo, points out that the Border Patrol is about 2,000 agents short of its congressionally mandated minimum. \nHe and his union -- which represents about 18,000 agents, according to its website, and endorsed Trump in the 2016 election -- will take any help it can get. \n\"Anything that will support Border Patrol agents in their operations, we welcome it from President Trump,\" Garza said. He said troops could support the agents by providing manpower and resources, particularly when it comes to surveillance operations. \nBut as things stand right now, he said, it's impossible for border agents to continue doing their jobs effectively without the proper manpower. The money, Garza said, would be well spent. \n\"We are very confident that under this military deployment that Trump has talked about that it's going to be done in an efficient manner that will help our Border Patrol agents and the American public,\" he said. \nThe Trump administration and the Department of Homeland Security have yet to answer questions about how much a military deployment would cost, but those by Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama combined cost more than $1.3 billion. \n\"It is a lawless part of the border,\" Garza added. \"When we have 50 people getting across in one hour, undetected, and they successfully come into our country, that's a lawless border.\" \nSheriff says it's a waste of money \nTom Schmerber has been sheriff of Maverick County, Texas, north of Laredo, for six years but spent most of his career as a Border Patrol agent. \nBack then, he sometimes worked side by side with military personnel stationed on the border. But that kind of support is no longer needed, Schmerber told CNN. \"Everything has changed.\" \nResidents of his county, Schmerber said, are safe thanks to the efforts of Border Patrol and local law enforcement. \n\"I think that the Border Patrol (agents) are well-trained, well-equipped,\" he said. \"I don't think we need the military here at the border.\" \nSchmerber said he believes the money spent could be better used by local sheriffs' offices. They're typically understaffed and lack the necessary technology to monitor border crossings effectively. \n\"We need a lot of equipment,\" he said, pointing to cameras that could monitor the Rio Grande, or a drone that his deputies could monitor from the office, instead of roaming around. \"Technology is what we need right now.\" \n'The border's wide open' \nIn Del Rio, Texas, rancher Frank Hargrove said he'd support troops being sent to the border. \"It's a good deal,\" he told CNN. \"Border Patrol (is) simply overrun. I mean, the border's wide open.\" \nHargrove doesn't fear for his safety, he said, or that of his family, but the volume of immigrants crossing the border has gotten out of hand. \"They don't catch, I don't even think, half of what comes across.\" \nHargrove, 56, has lived in the area his entire life, and he said he believes the problem has probably gotten worse in the last decade. Hargrove doesn't see many border crossings nowadays -- phones and GPS help migrants map their routes and stay hidden, he said -- but he'd still like to see some more support from the National Guard. \n\"It's just what they're bringing across and who could be coming across that kind of worries us.\" \nIt's better than the wall, dual national says \nBut across the river in Mexico, in Ciudad Acuña, Rommel Rodriguez, 21, said placing troops on the border near his town would be unnecessary. \nRodriguez has dual nationality, he said, and doesn't think having US troops on the border would bother Mexicans. But they could be more useful in \"dangerous\" towns such as Juarez or Tijuana, he said. \nBut he added, \"It's better than building the wall, you know,\" referring to Trump's long-promised barrier he'd like to see constructed along the border. \"It's less money.\" \n\"It wouldn't insult me as a Mexican,\" he told CNN. \"I mean it would be safer ... and more secure borders.\" \nCNN's Ed Lavandera reported from Laredo, Texas. CNN's Gary Tuchman and Jennifer Griffiths reported from Eagle Pass, Texas. CNN's Dakin Andone reported and wrote from Atlanta. \nTM &© 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Homeland Security to compile database of journalists, media infl - KTVQ.com | Q2 | Continuous News Coverage | Billings, MT Member Center: Homeland Security to compile database of journalists, media influencers Posted: Updated: By CBS News \nThe Department of Homeland Security posted a contract request this week for \"Media Monitoring Services,\" which will compile a database of hundreds of thousands of journalists, bloggers and \"media influencers\" for the federal government. After an outcry on social media, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman tweeted \"this is nothing more than the standard practice of monitoring current events in the media.\" \nThe work request from DHS seeks a firm that has the ability to monitor up to 290,000 global news sources; ability to track media coverage in up to 100 languages and the ability to \"track online, print, broadcast, cable, radio, trade and industry publications, local sources, national/international outlets, traditional news sources, and social media.\" \nThe work request also seeks the ability to build lists of journalists based on beat, location, outlet type/size and journalist role. Creating an online \"media influence database\" is also included. \nDHS spokesman Tyler Q. Houlton tweeted that \"despite what some reporters may suggest,\" this is \"standard.\" \n\"Any suggestion otherwise is fit for tin foil hat wearing, black helicopter conspiracy theorists,\" Houlton wrote. Despite what some reporters may suggest, this is nothing more than the standard practice of monitoring current events in the media. Any suggestion otherwise is fit for tin foil hat wearing, black helicopter conspiracy theorists. https://t.co/XGgFFH3Ppl — Tyler Q. Houlton (@SpoxDHS) April 6, 2018 \nResponses are due April 13. \nThe news comes amid attacks on the media by President Trump, who frequently calls mainstream media outlets \"fake news.\" Watchdog organization Freedom House said in its 2017 press freedom report that global media freedom has reached its lowest level in 13 years -- including attacks by Mr. Trump. \n\"But it is the far-reaching attacks on the news media and their place in a democratic society by Donald Trump, first as a candidate and now as president of the United States, that fuel predictions of further setbacks in the years to come,\" the report said. \n© 2018 CBS Interactive Inc.

Minnesota Twins pitcher Jose Berrios throws against the Seattle Mariners in the first inning of a baseball game Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Minneapolis. \nBy TYLER MASONAssociated Press \nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Playing in a Twins-record low of 27 degrees, the Seattle Mariners eventually heated up at the plate as Kyle Seager and Guillermo Heredia homered Saturday in an 11-4 win over Minnesota. \nThe first-pitch temperature at Target Field beat the Minnesota mark of 31 degrees for a game in 2014. Coors Field in Denver holds the major league low with a 23-degree day in April 2013 when Atlanta visited the Rockies. \nRyon Healy drove in three runs as the Mariners helped Mike Leake (2-0) win again. \nSeattle didn't manage a hit against Twins starter Jose Berrios (1-1) through three innings. Robinson Cano hit an RBI single in the fourth and Seager connected for a 3-0 lead. \nThe Mariners added two more runs in the fifth off Berrios when Dee Gordon rolled a two-run single through a drawn-in infield to make it 5-0. Berrios was pulled from the game after 4 2/3 innings - his shaky start came one outing after he tossed a shutout in his season debut at Baltimore. \nMinnesota chipped away with a three-run sixth inning. Joe Mauer and Miguel Sano led off with back-to-back doubles, and Eddie Rosario and Eduardo Escobar followed with RBI singles. \nThe Twins threatened in the seventh by loading the bases with one out but couldn't push across another run against Seattle's bullpen. \nThe Mariners added insurance during a five-run eighth inning, including a three-run double by Healy and a two-run homer by Heredia. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nMariners: C Mike Zunino (right oblique strain) could join the team when the Mariners return to Seattle next week after their current road trip, manager Scott Servais said. He was eligible to return from the disabled list on Saturday. \nTwins: RHP Phil Hughes (strained left oblique) threw a side session after pitching five innings in a rehab assignment Thursday in Fort Myers, Florida. Manager Paul Molitor said the team will continue to monitor Hughes on a day-to-day basis. . RHP Ervin Santana (finger) will fly back to Minneapolis on Tuesday to be examined by team doctors. \nUP NEXT \nMariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (1-0, 4.26 ERA) makes his second start of the year after earning a win in 6 1/3 innings against San Francisco. \nTwins: RHP Lance Lynn (0-1, 11.25) is looking to bounce back from his first start with the Twins, a loss against Pittsburgh.

Marc Leishman, of Australia, shoots around a tree   second   Friday, April 6,   \nAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - The Latest on Saturday's third round at the Masters (all times local): \n6:55 p.m. \nFour-time major winner Rory McIlroy is already trying to play mind games with Patrick Reed heading into the final round of the Masters. \nMcIlroy and Reed will be in the final pairing on Sunday. It could shape up to be the kind of showdown typically seen in the Ryder Cup. \nReed made two eagles on the back nine and shot a 5-under 67 in the third round at Augusta National, just a few miles down the road from where he went to college. Reed is at 14-under 202 heading into the final round. No one has ever shot all four rounds at the Masters in the 60s. \nReed also has a shot at the Masters record of 18 under, set by Tigers Woods in 1997 and tied by Jordan Spieth in 2015. \nMcIlroy shot a 7-under 65 Saturday and will start the final round three strokes behind the leader. \n\"All the pressure's on him\" Sunday, McIlroy said. \"I'm hoping to come in and spoil the party.\" \nReed is looking for his first major championship. \nMcIlroy is seeking his final major in a career Grand Slam. \n\"It's massive,\" McIlroy said. \"This is my first final group here since 2011, and I feel like I learned an awful lot that day.\" \nRickie Fowler is 9 under, one shot ahead of Jon Rahm and two strokes better than Henrik Stenson. \n___ \n6:10 p.m. \nPatrick Reed made two eagles in three holes to extend his commanding lead at the Masters. \nReed got to 6 under in the third round at Augusta National and 15 under for the week at golf's first major. He has a four-stroke lead over Rory McIlroy after missing a 7-footer and giving one back on the par-3 16th. \nNo matter how he finishes, he will leave the course with two huge highlights on \"Moving Day.\" \nReed reached the par-5 13th in two shots and made a 14-footer for the first eagle. He second one was even better . Reed was short of the green on the par-5 15th - he hit a 3-wood 240 yards over a pond - but then holed out from about 30 yards. He chipped onto the green and watched it roll right into the cup. \nHe delivered a demonstrative fist pump and let out a yell as the gallery roared. \n___ \n5:20 p.m. \nPatrick Reed's birdies keep coming in bunches. \nReed responded in a huge way to Rory McIlroy's eagle at the par-5 eighth by making three straight birdies in the third round at Augusta National on Saturday. He posted red numbers on Nos. 8, 9 and 10, and headed to Amen Corner with a three-stroke lead. \nIt's the fifth time in 46 holes that Reed strung together back-to-back-to-back birds. The 27-year-old Texan is seeking his first victory at a major championship. \nReed gave one shot back when he flew the green at the par-3 12th and barely missed an 11-footer for par amid a sudden downpour. \n___ \n4:45 p.m. \nPhil Mickelson found a silver lining - crystal, really - in the third round at the Masters. \nMickelson shot a 2-over 74 Saturday thanks partly to making a triple bogey and a bogey on the first two holes. He is at 7-over 223 heading into the final 18 holes Sunday. \nThe highlight of the third round will be making an eagle at the par-5 eighth. It was the 19th eagle of his career at the Masters, and each one comes with a commemorative crystal glass. \nMickelson says \"it wasn't a total loss\" and adds \"you can never have enough crystal.\" \nIt might even help him forget about the first few holes, specifically the shot in which completely missed the ball trying to get back to the fairway. He punched out, missed the green and wound up with a triple bogey. \n___ \n4:15 p.m. \nThere's a new name near the top of the leaderboard at the Masters. \nRory McIlroy chipped in for an eagle at the par-5 eighth in the third round at Augusta National and briefly tied 36-hole leader Patrick Reed at 9 under. McIlroy responded with a dramatic fist pump while biting his bottom lip. \nReed made a birdie on the same hole a few minutes later and reached 10 under. \nMcIlroy was about 20 yards right of the green with his second shot and delivered a nearly perfect chip that bounced a few feet short of the green and starting tracking toward the pin. The shot would have rolled well past the hole, but it hit the stick and dropped in for a 3. \nIt could end up being the shot of the day. \n___ \n4:05 p.m. \nPaul Casey credited his best round of the week at the Masters to a marker and a mattress. \nCasey shot a 3-under 69 in the third round Saturday and made a decent move up the leaderboard. He was in the first group off the tee and played alongside Augusta National club champion Jeff Knox, who typically fills in when an odd number of players make the cut at the Masters. \nThey played in 3 ½ hours, about two hours fasters than threesomes averages during the first two rounds, and Casey called it \"the best experience I've ever had with a marker.\" \nCasey found one more reason for his improved play: He slept in his 3-year-old son's bed the last few nights in hopes of loosening up a tight hip. \nCasey didn't like the mattress in the house he rented near the course, so he bunked with his kid in \"a proper bed.\" \n___ \n3:15 p.m. \nTiger Woods is making a move - in the world rankings, not the Masters leaderboard. \nWoods is expected to crack the top 100 for the first time in years following golf's first major. \nWoods shot an even-par 72 in the third round Saturday at Augusta National and is at 4-over 220 through three rounds. He continued to struggle with iron play, failing to get a grip on distance control. \nHe says \"my swing is just off with my irons.\" \nThe 42-year-old Woods is playing the Masters for the first time since 2015. He is back following a fourth back surgery. \nHe started the week ranked No. 103 in the world, but should move up several spots after making the cut at golf's first major. \nWoods says he is \"just kind of gradually working on it, gradually building,\" adding, \"I'm getting there.\" \nWoods won't win a fifth green jacket and says he now has a modest goal for the final round: \"Even par or even in the red. Hopefully, I can get it done.\" \n___ \n2:55 p.m. \nMatthew Fitzpatrick made a huge move on \"Moving Day\" at the Masters. \nThe 23-year-old Englishman shot a 5-under 67 in the third round Saturday at Augusta National, getting to even-par 216 for the tournament. He's surely to make one of the biggest jumps - maybe even the biggest - heading into the final round. \nFitzpatrick made four birdies and an eagle - all in a nine-hole stretch - to surge up the leaderboard. \nFitzpatrick, who has four wins on the European Tour, is in the Masters for the fourth consecutive year. He first made the tournament after winning the U.S. Amateur in 2013 and making the field the following year. He missed the cut. \nHe tied for seventh in 2016. \nUmbrellas were out early at the golf course with light, intermittent rain falling. Play has not been stopped though the forecast calls for steady showers all day. \n___ \n12:05 p.m. \nWhat will Phil do next? A little bit of everything. \nPhil Mickelson began the third round with a drive into the trees, and then he completely missed the ball trying to get back to the fairway. He punched out, missed the green and wound up with a triple bogey. He followed that with a bogey. \nAnd then on the par-5 eighth, Mickelson hit driver off the fairway to 8 feet and made eagle. He's tied for last place. He's no less entertaining. \nTiger Woods, meanwhile, made his first birdie on the par-3 sixth. He was 1 over for his round. Woods opened with 73-75. He has never had three consecutive rounds over par at any Masters, even as an amateur. \n___ \n10:45 a.m. \nTiger Woods and Phil Mickelson have begun their third rounds at the Masters and the umbrellas are out at Augusta National. \nThey were playing in a light rain and the forecast calls for steady showers all day. \nMickelson triple-bogeyed the first hole, his second triple of the tournament. Mickelson, who was playing the third round with Tyrrell Hatton, tripled No. 9 on Friday. \nWoods bogeyed the first hole. \nPatrick Reed leads the tournament at 6 under and is scheduled to tee off at 2:30. \n___ \n4:35 a.m. \nPatrick Reed is halfway home to his first major championship. \nHe got there by mostly staying out of trouble at daunting Augusta National and mastering the four par 5s. \nReed shot a 6-under 66 in the second round Friday and moved to 9-under 135 for the tournament. He takes a two-shot lead over Marc Leishman into Saturday's third round, which could be affected by rain. \nForecasts call for steady showers all day, the kind of weather that should soften up what had become a hard and fast test. \nThe way Reed has played, it's doubtful even Mother Nature can slow him down. \n\"I believe if I play the golf I know how to play, I can win majors,\" said Reed, a 27-year-old Texan who ended his college career 3 miles down the road at Augusta State. \"I need to stick to my game plan.\" \nReed and Leishman will be the final pairing Saturday, scheduled to tee off at 2:30 p.m. \n___ \nFor more AP golf coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Golf and https://apnews.com/tag/TheMasters Copyright   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

      "text": "\nWith an estimated 11,000 to 25,000 Liberians, Minnesota is thought to be home to one of the nation's largest Liberian communities. \nPresident Donald Trump has declined to renew a long-standing immigration policy that has allowed thousands of Liberians to remain in the U.S. almost since the onset of the the nation's civil war more than 28 years ago. With their temporary protected status expiring within a year, entire families may be uprooted. \n\" Liberia is a poor country,\" said Wilson, during a recent interview in his church basement. \"It's still struggling to rebuild itself. The infrastructure is all damaged. This country still does not have good paved roads in the cities. People use a lot of generators. It's embarrassing to even talk about. What's the point of sending immigrants back who are working really hard in this country?\" \nBUSINESS GROUPS ENGAGED \nTheir clearest shot at remaining in the U.S. \nThat may rest with support from Minnesota's business leaders, who are being asked to step up on behalf of employees. \nLiberians make up a large percentage of allied health workers such as nursing home employees and home health aides. Census surveys show that 36 percent of Liberian workers are employed in health-related fields. \nKamara, who has worked for Good Samaritan Society for more than 20 years, said she's recruited many Liberians as co-workers, including friends with temporary status. \n\"Many days and nights, they can't sleep because they're worried what will happen,\" she said. \"The parents can't sleep, the children can't sleep. What will happen to their dad, to their mom?\" \nSome business leaders are listening. \n\"Their presence here has been good for everybody. Why wouldn't we come up with a permanent solution?\" said Bill Blazar , senior vice president with the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce . \"Overall, Minnesota's labor market is tight. Losing a group that is a significant contributor to our health care system, that's something that all Minnesotans should be concerned about. Immigrants are key to the development of Minnesota's economy.\" \nLabor organizers with SEIU Healthcare Minnesota say several nursing home management companies -- whom they've sometimes tangled with on labor issues -- are considering working with them on a joint advocacy campaign, though nothing is finalized. \n\"We're trying to make an economic case,\" said Wynfred Russell , a Liberian and co-founder of the Brooklyn Park -based networking and advocacy organization African Career, Education and Resources Inc. , or ACER. \"A number of the big nursing home companies, they've been working very closely with us. They rely heavily on Liberian workers.\" \nPEACEFUL TRANSITION IN AN UNSTABLE COUNTRY \nOn ",

(Source: Pixabay) \n(RNN) - Firefighters battled a four-alarm fire at Trump Tower in Manhattan on Saturday, where one person received a \"serious\" injury. \nThe injured person was the occupant of a residential apartment where the fire started, New York City Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said at a press conference. \nHe also said four firefighters received \"non-life-threatening\" injuries, two with burns and two with other kinds of injuries. \nThe fire was mostly out though not considered technically contained due to continuing smoke conditions. \nThe fire broke out on the 50th floor of the building. Fire crews responded just before 6 p.m. ET after receiving a call at 5:35 p.m. from an automatic alarm system, Nigro said. #FDNY members remain on scene of a 4-alarm fire, 721 5th Ave in Manhattan. There is currently one serious injury to a civilian reported.

(Source: AP Photos) \nNIPAWIN, Saskatchewan (AP) - A semi-trailer slammed into a bus carrying a youth hockey team in western Canada, killing 15 people and injuring 14 in a catastrophic collision that a doctor compared to an airstrike and left the vehicles obliterated in the snow. The crash sent shockwaves through the team's small hometown and a country united by the national sport. \nCanadians were moved to tears on Saturday as they learned of the identities of the deceased on the bus that was driving the Humboldt Broncos hockey team to a crucial playoff game Friday against the Nipawin Hawks. \n\"An entire country is in shock and mourning,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. \"This is every parent's worst nightmare. No one should ever have to see their child leave to play the sport they love and never come back.\" \nThe bus had 29 passengers, including the driver, when it crashed at about 5 p.m. on Highway 35, police said. Among the dead are Broncos head coach Darcy Haugan, team captain Logan Schatz and radio announcer Tyler Bieber. Authorities earlier said three were in critical condition but later provided an update to say that 15 have now died. \nCanadian police said the truck driver was initially detained but has since been released and provided with mental health assistance. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said it's too early to state a cause for the crash. \nIn a tweet, U.S. President Donald Trump said he called Trudeau to offer his condolences to the families of victims. \nDarren Opp, president of the Nipawin Hawks, said a semi T-boned the players' bus - an account police confirmed. \n\"It's a horrible accident, my God,\" Opp said. \nHassan Masri, an emergency room doctor at Saskatoon's Royal University Hospital who has done work in war-torn Syria, said the crash reminded him of an airstrike. \nPhotographs of the wreckage showed the twisted trailer with most of its wheels in the air and the bus on its side and its back portion destroyed. The force of the crash sent both vehicles into the ditch at the northwest corner of the intersection. \nAerial footage showed the bus on its side, its roof peeled back and its front end destroyed. The trailer of the truck lay nearby in a shattered mess, with bags of its peat moss cargo scattered all around. The tractor part of the truck was intact, lying on its passenger side. \nThe tractor-trailer would have had to yield to a stop sign before crossing over the highway that the hockey bus was travelling on. There is a stand of trees on the southeast corner of the intersection, limiting visibility of the approach on both roads. \nPolice said a lot of issues have to be investigated, including weather conditions at the time and any mechanical issues with the vehicles. \nThe tragedy brought to mind an accident in 1986, when the Swift Current Broncos team bus slid off an icy highway and crashed in late December, killing four players. \nThe Humboldt Broncos are a close-knit team from the small city of Humboldt, Saskatchewan, which has a population of about 6,000. Many gathered at the community center at the hockey arena there after word of the horrific crash began to circulate. \nHumboldt Mayor Rob Muench, wearing a green and yellow Broncos team jersey, hugged people Saturday morning as they came to the Elger Petersen Arena in the Saskatchewan town to comfort each other and learn more. \n\"It's overwhelming. It's been tough on everybody,\" Muench said in a phone interview. \"We're a small community; some of those kids have been on the team for a number of years. A lot grew up in the community and everybody knows each other.\" \nThe team was on its way to play in Game 5 of a semi-final against the Nipawin Hawks. \n\"Hockey was what brought us all together and we had two communities that were rivals in the rink. To find out that it was their first responders that aided our boys just warms your heart,\" the mayor said as his voice cracked. \nMultiple crisis workers were assisting relatives and friends. \n\"Everybody is just so devastated. These poor young boys,\" said Penny Lee, the communications manager for the town of Humboldt. \nThe Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League is a junior 'A' hockey league under Hockey Canada, which is part of the Canadian Junior Hockey League. It's open to North American-born players between the ages of 16 and 20. \nTeam President Kevin Garinger said parents from across western Canada were struggling to cope with the tragedy and were rushing to the scene. \n\"We are heartbroken and completely devastated,\" Garinger said. \"We will never forget the members of our Broncos family who were taken from us and who were injured.\" \nMichelle Straschnitzki, who lives in Airdrie, Alberta, said her 18-year old son Ryan was transported to a hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. \n\"We talked to him, but he said he couldn't feel his lower extremities so I don't know what's going on,\" she said. \"I am freaking out. I am so sad for all of the teammates and I am losing my mind.\" \nKevin Henry, a coach who runs a hockey school in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, said he knows players on the team. \n\"This is I would think one of the darkest days in the history of Saskatchewan, especially because hockey is so ingrained in how we grow up here,\" he said. \nThe hockey world issued messages of condolences, including Saskatchewan native Mike Babcock, who is the Toronto Maple Leafs coach. \nBabcock, fighting back tears, said that \"it's got to rip the heart out of your chest.\" \nThe Chicago Blackhawks and Winnipeg Jets wore the name \"BRONCOS\" instead of their nameplates on Saturday night. \n___ \nRob Gillies contributed to this report from Toronto and Ivan Moreno contributed from Milwaukee.

Marc Leishman, of Australia, reacts after his putt on the second hole during the second round at the Masters golf tournament Friday, April 6, 2018, in Augusta, Ga. \nBy DOUG FERGUSONAP Golf Writer \nAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - Patrick Reed and Rory McIlroy meet again, this time for a green jacket instead of a gold Ryder Cup trophy. \nReed seized control of the Masters on a wet Saturday at Augusta National with a pair of eagles on the back nine and a 5-under 67 that gave him a three-shot lead. McIlroy, who chipped in for eagle on the front nine to briefly tie for the lead, made an 18-foot birdie on the final hole for a 65 to nudge a little closer. \nThis is not match play as it was for their singles match in Ryder Cup at Hazeltine. \nIt sure feels like it. \nAnd it sounded about as loud, too, especially with players taking advantage of greens slightly softened by the rain. \nReed ran off three straight birdies around the turn, and he stretched his lead to as many as five shots with his eagles. \nHe made a 15-foot eagle putt on the 13th, and then he showed he was not in the mood to play it safe on the 15th. From just under 270 yards, as the rain made the air heavy, Reed hit 3-wood just over the water and short of the bunker, and his chip from 80 feet slammed against the pin and dropped. Reed pumped his fist, the kind of emotion he typically saves for the Ryder Cup. \nHe narrowly missed a 10-foot birdie putt at the end and was at 14-under 202. \nMcIlroy can only hope he didn't use up all his luck. \nA chip that likely would have gone off the green at the par-5 eighth banged into the pin and dropped for eagle. He managed to find his second shot among the azaleas on the 13th to escape with par. And he got into the final group, an ideal position as he goes after the final leg of the career Grand Slam. \n\"There's a lot more players in this tournament than just Patrick and I,\" McIlroy said. \"It won't be quite as intense, but we'll still be feeling it. Patrick is going for his first (major), and I'm going for ... something else.\" \nHe paused to smile when he heard a few chuckles. That \"something else\" is a collection of four majors that only five other players can claim. \n\"It's going to be good fun,\" McIlroy said. \nRickie Fowler made eagle on the par-5 second and was 5 under through eight holes. He cooled until the end of his round, when a pair of birdies over the last two holes gave him a 65 and left him five shots behind. Jon Rahm of Spain also chipped in for eagle on No. 8 and saved par on the 13th after hitting into the creek in his round of 65. He was at 8-under 208. \nTiger Woods had to significantly lower his goal this week. He shot 72, was 18 shots behind and now hopes to finish the tournament under par. \nSo many others who started the third round with a chance didn't do nearly enough to stay even remotely close to Reed. Justin Thomas (70), Jordan Spieth (71) and Dustin Johnson (71) all are at least nine shots behind. \nReed and McIlroy are linked so indelibly to that singles match at Hazeltine in 2016 when they produced the highest quality of golf amid ear-splitting cheers, making big putts on top of the other. Reed prevailed on the 18th hole in a rare U.S. victory at the Ryder Cup. \nNow it's about stroke play. Now it's about history of their own, not a trophy they share. \n\"All the pressure is on him,\" McIlroy said. \"He went to Augusta State. He's got a lot of support here. I'm hoping to come in and spoil the party.\" \nMcIlroy has plenty on him, too. \nThe Masters is where he threw away a four-shot lead in the final round, and now it's the missing piece of a career slam. \n\"Hopefully, all I did learn seven years ago, I can put into practice,\" McIlroy said. \"I've been waiting for this chance.\" \nReed doesn't have a major. He doesn't have experience of a big stage, a big crowd and enormous pressure. That came from Hazeltine and a match described as \"one of the best we ever played.\" \n\"The biggest thing I can pull from it is going head-to-head with Rory and I was able to put together a good round,\" he said. \nBut he shrugged off any other comparisons, starting with the decorum outside the ropes at Augusta National compared with a flag-waving crowd at the Ryder Cup. \nReed also doesn't buy into the idea that the pressure is all on him. \n\"I am leading,\" he said. \"At the same time, he's going for the career Grand Slam.\" \n___ \nFor more AP golf coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Golf and https://apnews.com/tag/TheMasters   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

The stewards disqualified Sporting Chance from third to fourth and moved Free Drop Billy up to third after he was forced wide by Sporting Chance in the stretch. \nFree Drop Billy returned $3.60 to show and earned 20 points, while Sporting Chance got 10 points for fourth. \nWOOD MEMORIAL \nVino Rosso survived a stewards' inquiry to win the $1 million Wood Memorial and earn 100 points toward qualifying for the Kentucky Derby. \nRidden by John Velazquez, Vino Rosso ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:49.79 at Aqueduct on Saturday for trainer Todd Pletcher. \nVino Rosso and Enticed hooked up at the top of the stretch and dueled until Vino Rosso pulled away nearing the finish. \nIt appeared that Vino Rosso came over and bumped Enticed along the rail hard twice in the stretch. That prompted the stewards' inquiry and an objection but after video review, there was no change to the order of finish. \nSent off at 4-1 odds, Vino Rosso paid $10.40, $4.40 and $3.40. \nEnticed returned $2.90 and $2.40, while Restoring Hope, trained by Bob Baffert, paid $3.30 to show.

      "text": "Justify wins Santa Anita Derby by 3½ lengths for Baffert 2018-04-07T23:37:56Z \nBy BETH HARRISAP Racing Writer \nARCADIA, Calif. (AP) - Justify vaulted into the role of probable Kentucky Derby favorite with a three-length victory over Bolt d'Oro in the $1 million Santa Anita Derby. \nTrained by Bob Baffert and winner of his three career starts by a combined 19 lengths, Justify had to finish first or second on Saturday to earn enough qualifying points to run in the Derby on May 5. \nIt wasn't a problem. \nJustify led all the way under Mike Smith to claim the 100 points toward qualifying for the Run for the Roses. The colt ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:49.72 and paid $3.80, $2.20 and $2.10 as the 3-5 favorite in the field of seven. \nBolt d'Oro returned $2.20 and $2.10, while Core Beliefs was another 6½ lengths back in third and paid $4 to show. \nBolt d'Oro and Javier Castellano chased Justify into the stretch turn. Castellano moved his colt down toward the rail and they ranged up on Justify's flank, but never seriously threatened. Justify continued to pull away approaching the finish line. \nBLUE GRASS \nGood Magic overtook Flameaway entering the stretch to win the $1 million Blue Grass Stakes by 1½ lengths at Keeneland and earn 100 qualifying points for the Kentucky Derby. \nGood Magic, last year's 2-year-old champion and the 8-5 favorite, waited through a far-turn battle between Flameaway and Arawak before taking control and winning the Grade 2 race Saturday. \nTrained by Chad Brown, Good Magic earned his first victory since last fall's Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Del Mar and his second in five career starts. \nUnder jockey Jose Ortiz, Good Magic covered 1 1/8 miles in 1:50.18 and paid $5.20, $3.60 and $2.80. \nFlameaway returned $5 and $3.80 and earned 40 points. The stewards disqualified Sporting Chance from third to fourth and moved Free Drop Billy up to third after he was forced wide by Sporting Chance in the stretch. \nFree Drop Billy returned $3.60 to show and earned 20 points, while Sporting Chance got 10 points for fourth. \nWOOD MEMORIAL \nVino Rosso survived a stewards' inquiry to win the $1 million Wood Memorial and earn 100 points toward qualifying for the Kentucky Derby. \nRidden by John Velazquez, Vino Rosso ran 1 1/8 miles in 1:49.79 at Aqueduct on Saturday for trainer Todd Pletcher. \nVino Rosso and Enticed hooked up at the top of the stretch and dueled until Vino Rosso pulled away nearing the finish. \nIt appeared that Vino Rosso came over and bumped Enticed along the rail hard twice in the stretch. That prompted the stewards' inquiry and an objection but after video review, there was no change to the order of finish. \nSent off at 4-1 odds, Vino Rosso paid $10.40, $4.40 and $3.40. \nEnticed returned $2.90 and $2.40, while Restoring Hope, trained Baffert, paid $3.30 to show. \n___ \nAP Sports Writer Gary B. Graves in Lexington, Kentucky, contributed to this report.

Minnesota Twins pitcher Jose Berrios throws against the Seattle Mariners in the first inning of a baseball game Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Minneapolis. \nBy TYLER MASONAssociated Press \nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - On a frigid afternoon at Target Field, relief pitchers had no trouble warming up. \nThey simply abandoned the bullpens and found a more comfortable spot to get loose. \nIt was a Twins-record low of 27 degrees at gametime Saturday as the Seattle Mariners beat Minnesota 11-4. \nBecause of the below-freezing chill, relievers moved out of the shaded bullpens in left-center field. Instead, they got ready in the indoor batting cages near the clubhouses. \nWhen summoned, they ran to the mound from the dugout. \n\"The bullpens were probably 15-20 degrees colder. There's no sun down there,\" Mariners manager Scott Servais said. \"MLB worked with us on that, as did the Twins. It was the right thing to do.\" \nBoth teams employed five relievers on a day when facemasks and hooded sweatshirts were a standard part of the uniforms. \n\"That's the coldest ballgame I've ever been a part of,\" Servais said. \nThe first-pitch temperature beat the Minnesota mark of 31 degrees for a game in 2014. The Twins began playing outdoors in 1961 at Metropolitan Stadium - from 1982-2009, their home was inside the Metrodome. \nCoors Field in Denver holds the major league low with a 23-degree day in April 2013 when Atlanta visited the Rockies. \n\"I was getting picked on a lot of the time for having a hoodie on,\" Mariner center fielder Dee Gordon said. \"Then we went out, and everybody on their team had a hoodie on. I was like, 'Oh, I don't feel so bad.'\" \nKyle Seager and Guillermo Heredia homered, and Ryon Healy drove in three runs as the Mariners helped Mike Leake (2-0) win again. \nSeattle didn't manage a hit against Twins starter Jose Berrios (1-1) through three innings. Robinson Cano had an RBI single in the fourth and Seager connected for a 3-0 lead. \nThe Mariners added two more runs in the fifth off Berrios when Gordon rolled a two-run single through a drawn-in infield to make it 5-0. \nBerrios was pulled from the game after 4 2/3 innings - his shaky start came one outing after he tossed a shutout in his season debut at Baltimore. \n\"The early part of the game, I thought Jose threw the ball fairly well,\" Twins manager Paul Molitor said. \"He got hurt when he got behind on a couple of good hitters.\" \nMinnesota chipped away with a three-run sixth inning. Joe Mauer and Miguel Sano led off with back-to-back doubles, and Eddie Rosario and Eduardo Escobar followed with RBI singles. \nThe Twins threatened in the seventh by loading the bases with one out but couldn't push across another run against Seattle's bullpen. \nThe Mariners added insurance during a five-run eighth inning, including a three-run double by Healy and a two-run homer by Heredia. \nMOLITOR HONORED \nBefore the game, Molitor was presented with his trophy for being chosen as the AL Manager of the Year in 2017. \n\"It's a very nice award,\" Molitor said. \"For any manager to be in that conversation and have a chance to take home that hardware, a lot of other people did their jobs really well.\" \nMolitor led the Twins to an 85-77 record and a wild-card slot after the team won just 59 games one year earlier. \n1,000 HITS FOR SEAGER \nSeager picked up his 1,000th career hit with a single in the eighth. He became the ninth player in Mariners history to reach that milestone. \n\"That's pretty special,\" he said. \"That's something I'm pretty proud of.\" \nSeager now needs just 2,085 more hits to match teammate Ichiro Suzuki. \n\"At the rate I'm going, I think if I play until I'm about 73, I think I'll catch him,\" he said. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nMariners: C Mike Zunino (right oblique strain) could join the team when the Mariners return to Seattle next week after their current road trip, Servais said. He was eligible to return from the disabled list on Saturday. \nTwins: RHP Phil Hughes (strained left oblique) threw a side session after pitching five innings in a rehab assignment Thursday in Fort Myers, Florida. Manager Paul Molitor said the team will continue to monitor Hughes on a day-to-day basis. ... RHP Ervin Santana (finger) will fly back to Minneapolis on Tuesday to be examined by team doctors. \nUP NEXT \nMariners: LHP Marco Gonzales (1-0, 4.26 ERA) makes his second start of the year after earning a win in 6 1/3 innings against San Francisco. \nTwins: RHP Lance Lynn (0-1, 11.25) is looking to bounce back from his first start with the Twins, a loss against Pittsburgh.

Justin Thomas reacts after missing a putt on the 13th hole during the third round at the Masters golf tournament Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Augusta, Ga. \nBy MARK LONGAP Sports Writer \nAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - Dustin Johnson burned the edges. Jordan Spieth lipped out more than his fair share. Justin Thomas just never got comfortable on the greens. \nThree of the world's best golfers blamed putting woes for being mostly stagnant on Moving Day at the Masters on Saturday. \nWith everyone else around them moving up the leaderboard, Johnson, Spieth and Thomas didn't keep pace. And they had a similar culprit: The putter, arguably the most important club on Augusta National's treacherous greens. \nJohnson and Spieth each shot 1-under 71 in the third round. Thomas was one stroke better (70) and moved to 5 under heading into the final round. \nTheir body language on the greens told the story. They leaned left. They leaned right. They begged a little and pleaded a lot. They shook their heads, swung their putters through the air and walked off in a huff more often than not. \nNow, all them are considered long shots to win golf's first major of 2018. Third-round leader Patrick Reed is 14 under , three shots ahead of Rory McIlroy and five ahead of Rickie Fowler. \n\"I get to go out for one of my only stress-free rounds that I've ever really played at Augusta National,\" Spieth said. \nSpieth looked like he had solved his putting woes last week at the Houston Open and then again Thursday when he opened with a 6-under 66 that gave him a two-stroke lead after the first round. \nBut the 2015 Masters champion and two-time runner-up (2014, 2016) failed to adjust to the speed of the greens Saturday and had too much pace on too many. After needing just 24 putts in the opening round, the 24-year-old Texan had nine more in the third. \n\"There was just a lid on the hole,\" Spieth said, estimating that he lipped out five or six putts. \"I felt like I played a 4- or 5-under round, something to stay in this tournament, and just got kind of unfortunate on some of the lips.\" \nSpieth skirted edges on Nos. 2 and 3, missing birdie putts on consecutive holes and providing an early indicator of his round. \nJohnson knows the feeling. Ranked No. 1 in the world, Johnson had one huge mistake all day: A double bogey on the par-4 11th after driving way left into some bushes. \nThe only other difference between making a bunch of birdies on a course ripe for low scores was those pesky putts. \n\"Hit a lot of good putts, just nothing went in,\" the 33-year-old Johnson said. \"Every hole it seemed like I had a really good look at it, but couldn't get anything to go.\" \nHe has no plans to adjust, either. \n\"Just keep doing exactly what I'm doing,\" he said. \"I'm hitting good putts. I'm hitting them where I want to. It just burned the edges, wouldn't go in.\" \nThomas didn't have the same touch. The 24-old-old Kentucky native and the PGA Tour's reigning player of the year hit 17 of 18 greens in regulation - better than Reed or McIlroy in the third round - but needed 34 putts to shoot 2 under. \n\"To only shoot 2 under is a little disappointing. It's definitely frustrating,\" said Thomas, ranked second in the world. \"The first couple of days I could have gotten away with it; 2 under would have been a good score. But today it's not going to make up much ground, especially with the guys at the top of the leaderboard playing well and being softer conditions. There's nothing I can really do about it.\" \n___ \nFor more AP golf coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Golf and https://apnews.com/tag/TheMasters   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

That one was characterized as an electrical fire, and was mostly confined to the building's roof. \nThree people had minor injuries in that instance. \nSocial media posts showed smoke coming from the building and what appeared to be much of a part of the 50th floor in flames, with debris falling off the side.

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum). Rory McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, reacts to his birdie on the 15th hole during the third round at the Masters golf tournament Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Augusta, Ga. \nBy PAUL NEWBERRYAP Sports Writer \nAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - Rory McIlroy was laughing and bouncing and swaggering all the way around Augusta National. \nAfter his final stroke on a soggy Saturday, he delivered an emphatic pump of the fist. \nNo wonder he's so excited. \nThis is McIlroy's best chance yet to join one of golf's most exclusive clubs . \nTaking advantage of several fortuitous bounces, McIlroy shot a 7-under 65 Saturday to match his lowest score ever at the Masters , pushing him within three shots of the lead and into the final group with Patrick Reed. \nThere are plenty of days when a golfer feels like the breaks go against him. \nThis wasn't one of those days for McIlroy. \nHe chipped one in from 23 yards away for an eagle at the par-5 eighth hole . He saved par at the 13th after knocking his ball into a thick patch of pink azaleas. He watched an errant tee shot at the final hole ricochet back into the fairway, setting up a birdie that could have easily been a bogey. \n\"I rode my luck a little bit out there today,\" McIlroy conceded. \"Hopefully I don't have to rely on it too much tomorrow.\" \nThis is the fourth straight year that he's arrived at Augusta National looking to complete the career Grand Slam - a feat accomplished by only five of the game's greatest players. \nThe last three times, he was simply too far back to make a serious run at the green jacket on Sunday. \nThis time, it's right within his grasp, though he'll have to chase down a scorching-hot player who's turned in three straight rounds in the 60s. \n\"I feel like all the pressure is on him,\" the 28-year-old McIlroy said of Reed, who's never won a major title. \"He's got that to deal with and sleep on tonight. I feel like I can go out there and play like I've got nothing to lose.\" \nOf course, this isn't the first time McIlroy has put himself in position to win the Masters. Back in 2011, before he had any major titles on his resume, he led after each of the first three rounds, went to the final day with a four-stroke lead and was still ahead as he made the turn. He totally fell apart after that, playing the last nine holes at 7 over to finish with an 80. \nHe's played well since then at Augusta, including top-10 finishes each of the last four years. \nBut this is his clearest path to victory since that 2011 debacle. \n\"I've been waiting for this chance,\" McIlroy said. \"I always have said that 2011 was a huge turning point in my career. It was the day that I realized I wasn't ready to win major championships, and I needed to reflect on that and realize what I needed to do differently. But now I am ready.\" \nThis certainly feels different than seven years ago. \n\"Obviously, I'm not in the lead like I was going into that day, so I probably don't have as much pressure,\" he said. \"I don't have to protect anything. I can go out and sort of freewheel like I did today, which is a great position to be in. I wish I was a little closer to the lead or leading, but I'm in the final group and I've shot 65 on moving day at the Masters. It's all I can ask for.\" \nThe chip-in eagle sent up a roar that carried across the course. But McIlroy's most fortuitous hole was No. 13, the dogleg of a par-five that finishes off Amen Corner. \nWith the off-and-on rain really coming down, McIlroy yanked his second shot into the azaleas lining the left side of the green, the club flying out of his hand after the follow-through. As he walked toward the last place he saw his ball, he wasn't even sure he'd be able to find it. \nThen, McIlroy got an impromptu lesson in horticulture. \n\"It was a sea of pink,\" he said. \"But azaleas are actually pretty thin down below. They look pretty thick on top, but down below they are actually not too bad. I could take a stance and just sort of pick the club straight up and get it back down on top of it and just trundle it out through the pine straw and back on to the grass.\" \nMcIlroy advanced his ball to the edge of the green with his third shot, and then knocked it up within 4 feet of the cup before rolling in the par-saving putt. He birdied two of the last four holes to match Fowler and Rahm for the best 18-hole score of the tournament. \nNow, he's ready for a moment that seems like it's been six years in the making. \nAnd the stakes couldn't be higher. \nMcIlroy already has a U.S. Open, a British Open and a PGA Championship. \nThe Masters is the only missing link. \n\"Patrick is going for his first,\" McIlroy said, pausing for effect, \"and I'm going for something else. It's going to be good fun.\" \nWith that, McIlroy delivered one more smile on a day filled with them. \n___ \nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau expressed his condolences on Twitter to... By Ralph Ellis, Nicole Chavez and Carma Hassan CNN \n(CNN) -- A small town in Canada's Saskatchewan province mourned Saturday after a bus carrying a junior hockey team collided with a tractor-trailer, leaving 15 people dead and at least 14 injured. \n\"This is a dark moment for our city, our community, our province,\" Humboldt Mayor Rob Muench said Saturday afternoon at a news conference. \"There is no playbook on what to do in cases like this.\" \nMembers of the Humboldt Broncos hockey team were headed to the town of Nipawin for a playoff game Friday night when the crash happened north of Tisdale, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. \nThree of the 14 injured people were in critical condition, the RCMP said. Authorities have not identified the victims and would not confirm whether they were players or coaches. Twenty-nine people were on the bus. \nThe RCMP previously reported 28 people were on the bus, with 14 injured. \nExpressions of support poured in, much of it focused on a Twitter photo that showed three injured players grasping each other's hands while lying on hospital beds. \nTruck driver uninjured \nSpeaking at the news conference, RCMP Assistant Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said the wreck occurred around 5 p.m. Friday when the tractor-trailer, traveling west on Highway 335, collided with the bus traveling north on Highway 35. \nThe driver, who was the lone occupant of the tractor-trailer, was not injured in the collision, Zablocki said. He was detained initially but is not currently in custody and his case is not currently being investigated as a criminal investigation. \n\"Our investigators will be looking at all aspects of this accident to determine what took place,\" he said. \"It's too early to comment on the cause of the collision.\" \nThe Humboldt team was scheduled to play the Nipawin Hawks in the fifth game of a best-of-seven semifinal playoff series Friday. The teams played a lengthy game Wednesday that Nipawin won 6-5 in three overtimes in Humboldt, leaving Nipawin with a 3-1 series lead. \nLong bus rides \nThe tragedy was felt across Canada, where hockey is the dominant sport and making long bus rides to tournaments is a rite of passage for young players. \nCam Talbot, goalie for the Edmonton Oilers in the National Hockey League, tweeted: \"After all the hours spent on a bus with the boys over the years this one really hits home. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and communities affected by this horrible tragedy. #PrayersForHumboldt\" \n\"I think everybody can relate to this experience,\" said Muench, the mayor. \"Throughout Canada we see teens going out into the Canadian winters on buses all the time. \n\"And it's always a thought in parents' and fans' minds about what could happen, and unfortunately it has happened in Humboldt.\" \nPlayers aged 16 to 21 \nHumboldt, a town of about 6,000, has a long tradition of fielding teams in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. \nThe Broncos, like other teams in the league, attract players from different parts of Canada who stay with host families during the hockey season, the team's website said. \nHumboldt players range in age from 16 to 21, according to an online team roster. Thirteen of the 24 players listed on the roster come from Saskatchewan, with two from Humboldt. Most of the others list their hometowns as being in the province of Alberta. \n\"Our thoughts and prayers are extended to the families of our staff and athletes as well as to all who have been impacted by this horrible tragedy,\" Kevin Garinger, the team's president, said in a statement. \"Our Broncos family is in shock as we try to come to grips with our incredible loss.\" \nTown comes together \nIn Humboldt, people showed up at the Elgar Petersen Arena to offer support, according to CNN partner CBC. Daigon Elny, a member of last year's team, told CBC, \"We were a family. You come to the rink ... what's better than that? \n\"Now I don't know what goes on now.\" \nA gathering place also was established for families at Nipawin Apostolic Church so they can find out information on their loved ones, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. \nTrudeau, Trump condolences \nExpressions of sympathy poured in from around the globe. \nThe mayor said he talked on the phone with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who passed along condolences from world leaders. Trudeau also expressed his condolences on Twitter to the victims of the crash. \n\"I cannot imagine what these parents are going through, and my heart goes out to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy, in the Humboldt community and beyond,\" Trudeau tweeted. \nUS President Donald Trump tweeted: \"Just spoke to @JustinTrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible Humboldt Team tragedy. May God be with them all!\" \n\"We send condolence, comfort and strength to all affected by the devastating crash involving the Humboldt Broncos' team bus,\" the National Hockey League said on Twitter. \n\"I can't imagine being the parent or the wife or the kids at home going through something like this,\" Toronto Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock said at a press conference. \"It hurts.\" \nLooking to recover \nFriday's crash is not the first highway accident to kill hockey players in Saskatchewan. \nFour members of the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League died in a 1986 crash in the western province, CBC reported. A memorial to those players was erected at the crash site in 2016. \nAt the news conference, Garinger noted that the loss of life will be felt across Canada -- and by the players' host families as well. \n\"They're part of the families of these billets,\" he said. \"We try to support them the same way we try to support the other families.\" \nMuench said it will take a long time for Humboldt to recover. \n\"We're a small town and we're overwhelmed with the outpouring of condolences we've received,\" he said. \"We're asking for everyone's support and consideration in the coming days and weeks and months and years it will take us to get through this.\"? \nCNN's Artemis Moshtaghian, Jason Hanna and Tina Burnside contributed to this report. \nTM &© 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

      "text": "Fire at Trump Tower leaves 1 dead, 6 injured, says FDNY Posted: Fire at 50th floor at Trump Tower. By Amir Vera and Gabriela Milan CNN \nNEW YORK (CNN) -- One person was killed and six firefighters were injured in a four-alarm fire at Trump Tower on Saturday, according to the New York City Fire Department. \nThe person who died was a resident of the building's 50th floor who had been taken to the hospital in critical condition, department spokeswoman Angelica Conroy told CNN. \nThe victim was a 67-year-old man who was unconscious and unresponsive when firefighters pulled him out, the New York Police Department said, adding the medical examiner's office will determine the cause of death. \nThe fire was contained to the 50th floor of the tower, located on Fifth Avenue in New York. It was ruled under control around 9 p.m., about two hours after it was originally reported, the FDNY said in a tweet. \nThe six firefighters injured had non-life threatening injuries, Conroy said. \nNo members of the Trump family were at the tower during the fire, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said. President Donald Trump tweeted before the news of the death that the fire was out and \"very confined\" in the \"well built building\" and congratulated the firefighters. \nHis son, Eric Trump, also congratulated the firefighters before news of the death, saying \"the @FDNY and @NYPD are truly some of the most incredible people anywhere!\" \nThe fire at Trump Tower comes three months after a minor fire broke out in a cooling tower on the roof of the building, according to CNN affiliate WCBS-TV. Two people were injured in the fire that officials said may have been caused by electrical heaters inside the cooling tower. \nCNN's Gabriela Milan reported from New York and Amir Vera wrote in Atlanta.

      "text": "Rangers fire coach Alain Vigneault after missing playoffs 2018-04-08T03:37:59Z \nBy STEPHEN WHYNOAP Hockey Writer \nThe New York Rangers fired coach Alain Vigneault hours after they missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010. \nGeneral manager Jeff Gorton announced the firing Saturday night, a full day before the end of the NHL regular season but long after New York's playoff hopes were gone. \nThe Rangers will begin searching for his replacement immediately. \nThe Rangers made the playoffs in four of Vigneault's five seasons as coach, including a 2014 trip to the Stanley Cup Final. They went 226-147-37 in the regular season under Vigneault, who is third in regular-season and playoff wins in franchise history. \nNew York's front office decided in the middle of this season to go young, sell at the trade deadline and begin a rebuilding process in the hopes of becoming a title contender again. Vigneault repeatedly said he believed the Rangers would have made the playoffs if they didn't go in that direction. \n\"I believe and some other people also believe that we would have gotten in, but a tough decision was made for the long-term future of this organization and you have to respect it,\" Vigneault said recently. \nAfter a 5-0 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers on Saturday afternoon, the veteran coach said he expected to be back next season. \n\"I think my staff is the right staff for this job,\" Vigneault said. \"This is just my opinion, but I think one of the strongest assets of this organization is its coaching staff. They're experienced, we've been able to do it with veteran players, we've been able to do it with younger players, our development record.\" \nIt's unclear if assistants Lindy Ruff and Scott Arniel will return or be considered as head-coaching candidates. \nWhen Gorton announced the Rangers' pivot toward a youth movement, he said Vigneault's future would be decided after the season. Before being fired, Vigneault made a passionate case to keep his job. \n\"I've gone through every facet, whether it be a young team, an old team, once we know the team, every year is the same thing,\" Vigneault said. \"Once we know the team we try and put in a system, it maximizes their talent and their potential and try and mask and work on the areas that we need improvement.\" \nVigneault, who turns 57 in May, has coached 16 NHL seasons for the Montreal Canadiens, Vancouver Canucks and Rangers. His team made the playoffs 11 times, and he took Vancouver to the 2011 Cup Final. \nBecause of that track record, Vigneault should be a candidate to coach in the NHL next season, which would take the Rangers off the hook for his contract, which was extended in early 2017. \n___ \nMore NHL hockey: https://apnews.com/tag/NHLhockey Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

New Orleans Pelicans' Anthony Davis (23) shoots over Golden State Warriors' Kevin Durant, left, during the first half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Oakland, Calif. \nBy JANIE McCAULEYAP Sports Writer \nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) - Anthony Davis outdueled Kevin Durant down the stretch on the way to 34 points, and the New Orleans Pelicans snapped a 10-game losing streak to Golden State with a 126-120 win over the Warriors on Saturday night. \nDurant scored 19 of his 41 points in the third quarter to go with 10 rebounds and five assists. He made big 3-pointers with 6:39 remaining and at the 4:52 mark that got Golden State to 112-111, but the Pelicans kept answering. \nThe NBA Finals MVP made things more difficult after halftime on Davis, who also had 12 rebounds for the Pelicans while having his way with the Warriors' defense from the start. \nThe Pelicans beat the Warriors for the first time since April 7, 2015, in New Orleans, and at Oracle Arena for the first time since April 24, 2012. \nDurant also committed a costly late turnover that led to E'Twaun Moore's pullup jumper with 23.5 seconds left. KD lost the ball for another key steal less than a minute earlier but immediately got a rebound on the other end that led to Andre Iguodala's dunk on the other end to get Golden State to 121-119 with 1:01 left. \nQuinn Cook, who has been an admirable fill-in for the injured Stephen Curry after his promotion from the G League, added 21 points with five 3-pointers in the Warriors' final regular-season home game. \nThis was primarily the KD and Davis show. \nDavis shot 13 for 24, while Nikola Mirotic made four quick 3-pointers and six in all on the way to 28 points. Jrue Holiday scored 25 and Rajon Rondo dished out 17 assists. \nDurant tied the game on a layup just before halftime but Davis scored again to give him 19 points on 9-for-14 shooting in the first half. New Orleans led 67-65 after sizzling shooting by both teams - 59.6 by the Pelicans to 57.4 for Golden State and seven 3-pointers apiece. \nDraymond Green just missed a triple-double for the Warriors, finishing with 11 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists. He had seven of Golden State's 17 turnovers. \nTIP-INS \nPelicans: New Orleans had 39 assists, Moore adding seven. ... G Ian Clark missed his second straight game - this one against his former team - because of a sprained right ankle. ... New Orleans has given up 110 or more points in each of the last 11 regular-season meetings vs. the Warriors. \nWarriors: Iguodala, who had been uncertain to play with a sore left knee, received a second-quarter technical. ... Golden State will go with a center by committee for now, with Kevon Looney earning the start Saturday. ... Shaun Livingston was out to rest his sore right knee. The Warriors had won their previous five regular-season home finales. ... Golden State dropped to 10-4 in the first game of back-to-backs. ... Warriors President and COO Rick Welts was honored for his induction into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. \nCURRY PROGRESS \nStephen Curry did some light work on the court then iced his injured left knee before the game while munching popcorn at his locker. \nHe's still a week from having his sprained left knee re-evaluated and coach Steve Kerr ruled him out for the first round of the playoffs. \n\"We'll talk a week from today,\" Kerr said. \"There's nothing to report.\" \nCLOSE RACE \nThe Pelicans had a four-day break and dropped from fourth place to eighth in the Western Conference standings. \nThat's how wild this final stretch has been and still could be. \n\"It's the craziest thing I've ever seen,\" coach Alvin Gentry said. \"I've never seen anything like it.\" \nUP NEXT \nPelicans: At Clippers on Monday. \nWarriors: At Phoenix on Sunday looking for a 15th straight victory vs. the Suns and playing their 14th and last back-to-back. \n___ \nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

Houston Astros' Jose Altuve, left, hits a double during the first inning of a baseball game against the San Diego Padres, Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Houston. \nHOUSTON (AP) - Four-time Gold Glove first baseman Eric Hosmer overran a towering popup with two outs in the 10th inning Saturday night, allowing the ball to fall without being touched and giving the Houston Astros a bizarre 1-0 win over the San Diego Padres. \nA single by Brian McCann and a steal by pinch runner Derek Fisher - ruled safe after a video review flipped the call - set up the unusual ending. \nAlex Bregman hit the pop and Hosmer, signed to a rich free agent deal by the Padres, ran in to make the play. \nBut with reliever Phil Maton and third baseman Christian Villaneuva staying out of the way, Hosmer suddenly realized he was in trouble and had no chance to catch it. The ball plopped onto the grass a few feet behind him, between the plate, mound and first base. \nFisher scored without a throw on what was scored as a single. Last October at the same park, Bregman lined a single that scored the pinch running Fisher from second in the 10th inning to lift the Houston over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 5 of the World Series. \nChris Devenski (1-0) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the win. Robbie Erlin (0-1) took the loss. \nGerrit Cole struck out 11 in seven sharp innings for Houston, giving up five hits and walking none. Since being acquired by the champion Astros, he has given up one run in 14 innings and fanned 22, a franchise record for the most strikeouts through the first two starts. \nPadres starter Bryan Mitchell worked out six walks in 5 2/3 innings, allowing three hits. The Astros loaded the bases in the fifth, but Bregman flied out to end the threat. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nPadres: Reliever Kirby Yates exited the game after throwing just one pitch in the eighth. ... RHP Dinelson Lamet played catch up to 90 feet and will likely do the same again on Sunday as he continues to make progress in his recovery from elbow soreness that started in late March. \nAstros: Houston activated RP James Hoyt from the disabled list and optioned him to Triple-A Fresno. ... 1B Yuli Gurriel, on the disabled list after breaking his hand in February, was given an off day but will play the next three games on his rehabilitation assignment with Double-A Corpus Christi. \nUP NEXT \nPadres: Tyson Ross (1-0, 4.50 ERA) will start for San Diego in the final game of the three-game set. He earned a win in an 8-4 victory over Colorado this week. \nAstros: Charlie Morton (1-0, 0.00) allowed just three hits and two walks in a strong season debut where he blanked the Orioles in six innings. He's 5-1 with a 2.34 ERA in eight starts against San Diego. Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.   This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

(AP Photo/John Hefti). San Francisco Giants' Buster Posey (28) runs the bases after hitting a two-run home run against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the fourth inning of a baseball game in San Francisco, Saturday, April 7, 2018. \nBy MICHAEL WAGAMANAssociated Press \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Andrew McCutchen snapped out of a prolonged slump with five hits in six at-bats Saturday night. Midway through his seventh at-bat, he knew it was just a matter of time until he got hit No. 6. \nMcCutchen hit a three-run homer to cap a 12-pitch at-bat against reliever Wilmer Font, giving him a career-high six hits and the San Francisco Giants a 7-5 victory over Los Angeles on Saturday night. \n\"You're talking about a great hitter that was having a great night,\" Giants manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He topped it off really well, didn't he?\" \nMcCutchen fell behind Font 1-2 before fouling off seven pitches. He then turned on a high-and-tight 2-2 fastball and drove it into the seats in left field, scoring Kelby Tomlinson and Joe Panik, who both singled off Font (0-2). \n\"I was just trying to fight him off, fight him off, until I got comfortable enough to whatever he threw up there I was ready to hit,\" McCutchen said. \"He didn't elevate it too much there, and I was able to elevate.\" \nMcCutchen drove in four runs and raised his batting average from .083 to .258. The 2013 NL MVP got a hearty ovation from Giants fans for the walk-off blast, his first big moment with San Francisco since being acquired from Pittsburgh in an offseason blockbuster. \n\"Finally showed up today. Finally,\" McCutchen said. \"It's only what, Game 7, but when you're not getting hits, it feels like it's forever. Feels good to show up today and do the job.\" \nBuster Posey also homered for the Giants, who wasted leads of 1-0, 3-1 and 4-3 before winning on McCutchen's shot. Panik added three hits and Austin Jackson had two. \nRoberto Gomez retired three batters for his first major league win. The Giants emptied their bullpen by using nine relievers. \n\"They kept us in the ballgame,\" McCutchen said. \nThe Dodgers had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the 14th when Logan Forsythe singled in Yasiel Puig. \nThe game lasted 5 hours, 16 minutes after beginning two hours later than originally scheduled due to heavy rains that forced the postponement of Friday's game. It was the sixth rainout in AT&T Park history and the first since 2006. \nDodgers skipper Dave Roberts was down to one reliever when the game ended. Roberts also used two starting pitchers, Clayton Kershaw and Hyun-Jin Ryu, as pinch hitters. \nChase Utley homered, Corey Seager had two hits and reached base five times, and Cody Bellinger added a pair of singles for Los Angeles. \nThe Dodgers are 2-6, matching their worst start since 1976. \n\"We just came up short again,\" Roberts said. \"That's five runs in 14 innings. You have to look at each at-bat and the quality needs to get better. There needs to be a better pitch-to-pitch focus.\" \nUtley homered in the seventh, his first of the season. \nPosey's home run off starter Rich Hill was the first of the season for the Giants cleanup hitter and first since Aug. 8, 2017. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nDodgers: RHP Josh Fields pitched a scoreless inning after being reinstated from the paternity list before the game. RHP Zach Neal designated for assignment after originally being optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma City. The change was made after the team claimed RHP Alec Asher off waivers from Baltimore. \nSTARTING OFF \nHill beat the Giants on opening day in Los Angeles but wasn't as fortunate in San Francisco. The left-hander yielded three runs and five hits over five innings with six strikeouts and two walks. \nGiants starter Chris Stratton struggled with his control again. He allowed two earned runs but walked four in five-plus innings. \nUP NEXT \nLHP Clayton Kershaw (0-2, 2.25) of the Dodgers faces LHP Ty Blach (1-1, 5.79) on Sunday in a rematch of opening day starters. Kershaw lost the first round despite allowing one run over six innings while Blach owns a career 1.41 ERA against Los Angeles. \n___ \nMore AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook (0) pulls down a rebound in front of Houston Rockets forward PJ Tucker (4) during the first half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Houston. \nBy KRISTIE RIEKENAP Sports Writer \nHOUSTON (AP) - Russell Westbrook and Paul George each scored 24 points, and the Oklahoma City Thunder used a timely fourth-quarter run to pull away for a 108-102 win over the Houston Rockets on Saturday night. \nThe Thunder were down one with about seven minutes left before scoring the next 11 points. \nOklahoma City is vying with several teams for the final playoff spots in the loaded Western Conference. The victory gives the Thunder a 2-1 win in the season series and snaps the Rockets' 20-game home winning streak. \nJames Harden had 26 points for Houston, and Chris Paul added 17. \nPaul hit a step-back jumper and Gerald Green scored to give the Rockets a 92-91 lead with 7:09 left. But Westbrook scored five quick points to start an 11-0 run by Oklahoma City that made it 102-92 with about four minutes remaining. \nHouston went scoreless for more than four minutes, missing seven shots and committing three turnovers as Oklahoma City pulled away. The Thunder also blocked three shots in that span. \nThe Rockets scored five straight points with less than a minute left to get within five, but George made two free throws to help secure the win. \nCarmelo Anthony scored 22 points for Oklahoma City, including three of the Thunder's 10 3-pointers. \nThe Thunder led by as many as 11 in the first half, but Houston used a 5-1 spurt take a 62-61 lead at halftime. \nTIP-INS \nThunder: Westbrook also had 10 assists. ... Oklahoma City had five blocked shots, including two from Jerami Grant. ... Steven Adams added 12 points. \nRockets: Paul received a technical foul in the second quarter after arguing after being called for an offensive foul. ... Ryan Anderson missed his second straight game with a sprained left ankle. ... Eric Gordon also sat out for the second straight game with a sore left ankle. \nUP NEXT \nThunder: Visit Heat on Monday night. \nRockets: Visit Lakers on Tuesday night.

      "text": "Josef Newgarden wins IndyCar race in Phoenix 2018-04-08T01:48:05Z \nBy JOHN NICHOLSONAP Sports Writer \nAVONDALE, Ariz. (AP) - Josef Newgarden used four new tires to catch rookie Robert Wickens and win the IndyCar race Saturday night at ISM Raceway. \nNewgarden started fourth on a restart with eight laps left, and got around Wickens with three laps to go on the 1.022-mile oval. The defending series champion raced to his eighth IndyCar victory and third on an oval, finishing 2.994 seconds ahead of Wickens. \nWickens was making his first second career start - and first on an oval - for Schmidt Peterson Motorsports. \nAlexander Rossi was third, followed by Scott Dixon and James Hinchcliffe as Honda swept the first five spots in the first oval race of the season. Ed Jones, running second when he hit the wall in Turn 4 with 20 laps left to bring out the final caution, finished 20th. \nNewgarden gave owner Roger Penske his record ninth series victory at the track and 198th overall. \nSebastien Bourdais finished a lap down in 13th after starting from the pole. He led the first 43 laps, then slid in his pit box and struck a crew member on the first caution for Pietro Fittipaldi's brush with the wall. Bourdais dropped two laps down after a drive-through penalty for hitting the crew member. \nWill Power took over after that, keeping the lead until a green-flag stop on Lap 124. The Australian made light contact with the wall in Turn 2 on Lap 154, ending his night. He was 22nd. \nDuring the green-flag stops halfway through the race, Matheus Leist left his pit box before the crew replaced the left rear tire. Leist nearly hit an IndyCar official when he purposely spun to turn the car around. The loose tire rolled out of the way in the pit exit lane, and IndyCar didn't throw the caution flag. \nThe 250-lap race was the first oval event for the sleek new car designed to improve competition and cut costs.

PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Minnesota Duluth squeaked into the NCAA Tournament - and celebrated like crazy when it was over. \nKarson Kuhlman had a goal and an assist, and the Bulldogs beat Notre Dame 2-1 Saturday night to win the school's second NCAA hockey championship. \nJared Thomas also scored and Hunter Shepard stopped 19 shots for the Bulldogs (25-16-3). UMD also won the 2011 title at the Xcel Energy Center. \n\"We were fortunate enough to make the tournament and we ran with that opportunity,\" Kuhlman said. \nNo kidding. \nMinnesota Duluth looked like a long shot for the 16-team NCAA field after it dropped its second game in the National Collegiate Hockey Conference tournament on March 17. The Bulldogs needed six conference finals that evening to go their way. \nThey did, allowing UMD to edge Minnesota by .0001 in the formula used to determine the at-large teams. Notre Dame's overtime win over Ohio State in the Big Ten title game put the Bulldogs in the tournament. \n\"One day you think you owe them a little bit like a thank you and the next day you're playing them in the national title game,\" said Kuhlman, who was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. \nAndrew Oglevie scored and Cale Morris made 33 saves for Notre Dame (28-10-2), winless in two national title games. The Irish lost to Boston College in 2008. \n\"They became that team of destiny that you're always hoping to be at the end of the year,\" Notre Dame coach Jeff Jackson said. \nMinnesota Duluth lost to Denver in last year's championship. The Bulldogs had seven seniors on that team, and then three underclassmen departed early for the NHL, including the starting goaltender. \nFive of Minnesota Duluth's top six defensemen are freshmen, and Shepard, a sophomore, recorded a sub-2.00 goals against average with eight shutouts. \n\"We felt our forward group was pretty good. We were replacing scoring, but we had some good depth,\" coach Scott Sandelin said. \"The job that young group back there did, I think it really moved forward when Shep grabbed the net and played the way he did. It gave our whole team confidence.\" \nUMD has played 11 consecutive one-goal games in NCAA Tournament play, winning eight of them. \nFor the second straight game, the Bulldogs scored two first-period goals and held on. They beat Ohio State 2-1 Thursday. \nUMD took advantage of two Irish turnovers. \nPressured by Kuhlman, Notre Dame's Jordan Gross lost the puck in the neutral zone. Jade Miller poked the puck ahead to Kuhlman at the Irish blue line, and after a brief hesitation in the right circle, the captain beat Morris with a rising shot. \nAn aggressive forecheck led to Thomas knocking Andrew Peeke off the puck in the right corner. The puck went to Kuhlman and back to Thomas, who banked a shot from near the goal line off Morris and in with 1:21 left in the period. \nOglevie redirected a pass from Cam Morrison for a power-play goal in the second period to get the Irish on the board. \n\"There was never a panic, there was never any doubt in that room,\" Thomas said. \"If we needed to win the game 2-1, we were going to win the game 2-1. You saw it on third-period play where we really shut them down.\" \nStruggling to get pucks deep, Notre Dame had just five shots in the final 20 minutes. \nSince Feb. 21, 2015, UMD is 56-0-3 when taking a lead into the third period, including 23-0-1 this season. \nNotre Dame had won its previous five postseason games by one goal, with the game-winners coming in the final 31 seconds of regulation or overtime.

(AP Photo/Ben Margot). Golden State Warriors' Quinn Cook, right, breaks the fall of New Orleans Pelicans' Cheick Diallo (13) during the first half of an NBA basketball game Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Oakland, Calif. \nBy TIM REYNOLDS \nA look at the NBA playoff picture, with four days remaining in the regular season: \n___ \nEAST UPDATE \nThe bracket was unchanged Saturday. \nMilwaukee beat New York, improving to 43-37 on the season - tying Miami for the sixth-best record. But the Heat remain holders of the No. 6 seed, since they have the tiebreaker over the currently seventh-seeded Bucks. \nToronto now has the second-best record in the NBA. The Raptors are now a half-game ahead of Golden State. \n___ \nWEST UPDATE \nThe race is wild now: Six teams playing for five playoff spots, all to be decided over the next four days, and with all of those teams on either 45 or 46 wins. \nThere were no clinchers on Saturday, and - just like in the East - the potential first-round bracket was unchanged. San Antonio and Utah both could have wrapped up their postseason berths, but didn't get the help they needed from other teams. The Spurs pulled away in the fourth quarter to beat Portland, and Oklahoma City snapped Houston's 20-game home winning streak. \nThe Thunder, Pelicans and Spurs can all win their way into the postseason on Monday. Oklahoma City visits Miami, New Orleans visits the Los Angeles Clippers and San Antonio hosts Sacramento. \nMeanwhile, for the first time in seven years, the Clippers are not heading to the playoffs. \nDoc Rivers' team was eliminated, the final blow being a 134-115 loss to the Denver Nuggets. This will be the 13th time in franchise history the Clippers finish with a winning record, and in each of those years but one - until now - that's been good enough for a postseason berth. \nDenver, right now, is the odd team out. The Nuggets are ninth, but play their last two games against Portland and Minnesota, so they can still win their way into the postseason. \n___ \nSUNDAY'S GAMES \n- Dallas at Philadelphia: If the 76ers win, they move closer to securing the No. 3 seed in the East. \n- Indiana at Charlotte: Pacers would be assured of the No. 5 spot in the East with a loss; a win keeps their slim hopes of moving up alive. \n- Atlanta at Boston: Celtics will be No. 2 in the East, so there's really nothing to play for in this one. \n- Orlando at Toronto: The East's No. 1 seed, Toronto still has a shot at the NBA's second-best record. \n- Utah at L.A. Lakers: Jazz can clinch a playoff spot, and Quin Snyder has to be a coach of the year candidate. \n- Golden State at Phoenix: The Warriors aren't at their best, but a loss to the tanktastic Suns would be really bad. \n- Detroit at Memphis has no playoff implication. \n___ \nFirst-round matchups if the season ended Saturday ... \nEast: 1-Toronto vs. 8-Washington, 2-Boston vs. 7-Milwaukee, 3-Philadelphia vs. 6-Miami, 4-Cleveland vs. 5-Indiana. \nWest: 1-Houston vs. 8-Minnesota, 2-Golden State vs. 7-Oklahoma City, 3-Portland vs. 6-San Antonio, 4-Utah vs. 5-New Orleans. \n___ \nNOTE OF THE DAY \nA year ago, only one Western Conference playoff spot was decided in the final seven days. This year, five will be decided in the final four days. \n___ \nQUOTE OF THE DAY \n\"I just believe in protecting the league.\" - Doc Rivers, after the Clippers were eliminated, on why he expects to play his regulars against playoff-contending New Orleans on Monday.

      "text": "Fire at Trump Tower leaves man dead and 6 firefighters injured Posted: Fire at 50th floor at Trump Tower. By Amir Vera and Gabriela Milan CNN \nNEW YORK (CNN) -- A fire broke out at Trump Tower on Saturday, leaving one man dead and six firefighters injured, the New York City Fire Department said. \nPolice identified the man killed as Todd Brassner, 67, a resident of the building's 50th floor. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition but later died, said spokeswoman Angelica Conroy of the Fire Department. \nBrassner was unconscious and unresponsive when firefighters pulled him out, the New York Police Department said. The medical examiner's office will determine the cause of death. \nThe fire was contained to the 50th floor of the tower, located on Fifth Avenue in New York. It was ruled under control around 9 p.m., two hours after it was originally reported, the FDNY tweeted. \nSix firefighters suffered injuries that are not life threatening, Conroy said. \nNo members of the Trump family were at the tower during the fire, Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said. \nBefore news of the death, President Donald Trump congratulated firefighters and tweeted that the fire was out and \"very confined\" in the \"well built building.\" \nHis son, Eric Trump, also congratulated the firefighters before news of the death, saying \"the @FDNY and @NYPD are truly some of the most incredible people anywhere!\" \nThe fire at Trump Tower comes three months after a minor fire broke out in a cooling tower on the roof of the building, according to CNN affiliate WCBS-TV. Two people were injured in the fire, which officials said may have been caused by electrical heaters inside the cooling tower. \nCNN's Gabriela Milan reported from New York and Amir Vera wrote in Atlanta. CNN's Melanie Schuman, Tony Marco, Polo Sandoval and Linh Tran contributed to this report. \nTM &© 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

Evans-Smith won the fight. \nBy DAN GELSTONAP Sports Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - Khabib Nurmagomedov wanted an unsanctioned brawl against Conor McGregor in a loading dock. He instead ended his long ride toward a UFC title with a championship belt to bring back to Russia. \nNurmagomedov capped one the rockiest weeks in UFC's 25-year-history with a dominant outing over a bloodied Al Iaquinta to winn the 155-pound championship by unanimous decision in the main event of UFC 223 on Saturday night. \nMove aside, McGregor. Nurmagomedov is primed for main events, not just sideshows with dollies and broken glass. \n\"Where's Conor? You want to fight this bus?\" Nurmagomedov said. \nNurmagomedov won a belt stripped from McGregor this week because the tempestuous Irishman - who ignited a melee when he threw a hand cart and guard railing at a bus full of UFC fighters - had not fought for UFC in 17 months. \nHe's now the only fighter who can stake a claim to the lightweight title. \nNurmagomedov improved to 26-0 (10-0 in UFC) in a path to the lightweight championship much more laborious than his five rounds in the ring at Barclays Center. He won 50-43 on two scorecards and 50-44 on the third. \nNurmagomedov had four fights against interim champ Tony Ferguson fall through - the latest because of a freak knee injury that led to featherweight champ Max Holloway getting the call on six days' notice to move up in weight. Holloway was ruled medically unfit to compete on Friday, which forced UFC to bump Iaquinta from an undercard bout against Paul Felder to a title fight. \nNurmagomedov was on the bus and said he had to be restrained by security to keep from fighting McGregor in the underbelly of the arena. \nNothing stopped him against Iaquinta. \nThe 29-year-old Nurmagomedov once wrestled a bear as a child and he had no trouble busting open a clearly overmatched Iaquinta. He used takedowns in the first, second and fifth rounds that led to repeated blows to the back of the head that cleared the way to his first UFC title. \n\"I want to say thank you to Iaquinta for stepping up and fighting. He is a real Brooklyn gangster,\" Nurmagomedov said. \nNurmagomedov was the clear fan favorite - fans dotted the arena wearing papakhas, a hat that that looks like a powdered wig native to his homeland in Dagestan - and chanted \"Khabib! Khabib! Khabib!\" \nNurmagomedov lent his papakha to Joe Rogan and called out Georges St-Pierre for a fight later this year at Madison Square Garden. \nBut he was ready for a fight night doubleheader against anyone. \n\"Give me 30 minutes rest, little drink of water,\" Nurmagomedov said. \"Give me 30 minutes and I can fight with anybody. Tony, Conor it doesn't matter.\" \nRose Namajunas also was a passenger on the bus attacked by McGregor and was left so shaken she flirted with the idea of dropping out of her title fight. \nShe stuck with it - and kept her title. \nNamajunas made it 2 for 2 against Joanna Jedrzejczyk and defended her 115-pound championship with a unanimous decision victory in the co-main event. \nNamajunas (9-3) defeated Jedrzejczyk in the first round of their first match in November to win the strawweight championship. The 25-year-old Namajunas had to go the full 25 minutes to win 49-46 on all three scorecards. \n\"I just kept saying, 'I'm the best,'\" she said. \nShe wasn't sure what to think when the dolly McGregor hurled at the bus just missed her window. McGregor faces felony charges that put his fight future in doubt. \nUFC President Dana White said he had talked to McGregor about fighting in September but now everything is up in the air. \n\"I think there's a mutual respect between us,\" White said. \"I had so many things thrown at me this week. To focus on the show was insane. We'll get back and focus on Conor McGregor.\" \nMcGregor's agent, Audie Attar, wrote on Twitter that the former two-division champ \"looks forward to getting back to fighting as soon as possible.\" \nJedrzejczyk (14-2) and Namajunas appeared deadlocked through four rounds. Namajunas' lead left leg absorbed so many punishing kicks it turned bright red, but she bloodied Jedrzejczyk with a series of stiff shots to the face. Jedrzejczyk's right eye was about swollen shut in the fifth but she still landed some jabs that kept her hope alive of regaining her championship. \nNamajunas took down Jedrzejczyk with 30 seconds left and the crowd roared in the waning moments of a sensational championship fight UFC needed following \nJedrzejczyk threw her arm around Namajunas for a hug at the end of the bout. \nNicknamed \"Thug,\" Namajunas was soundly booed as the challenger in the first fight at Madison Square Garden. But she left to cheers and a champion then and was clearly the people's choice as she walked to the octagon five months later in Brooklyn. She shared a long embrace and a kiss with fiancee and training partner, Pat Barry. \nUFC needed a fresh face in the women's division with former champ and box office draw Ronda Rousey engaged in faux fighting in WWE. Rousey attended a WWE event Saturday night and was set to make pro wrestling debut in a bout Sunday at WrestleMania. She congratulated both Namajunas and Jedrzejczyk and said UFC was lucky to have them both. \nWhite will be in New Orleans to root for Rousey at pro wrestling's signature event. \nNamajunas, who preaches the power of positivity over trash talking, proved her first win was no fluke. \n\"I'm just better, man,\" she said. \nUFC got the main events it needed after the entire card was thrown into disarray the past week. \nAfter one of the UFC's most chaotic weeks - with McGregor led from a police station in handcuffs to face several charges - the promotion got down Saturday night to what it does best: Put on a show. \nBrooklyn was sold out with 17,026 fans at Barclays for a record gate of $3,007,108.12 for sporting events. \n\"Ridiculous considering the week we had,\" White said.

      "text": "Dozens suffocate in 'horrifying' suspected chemical attack in Sy - KTVQ.com | Q2 | Continuous News Coverage | Billings, MT Member Center: Dozens suffocate in 'horrifying' suspected chemical attack in Syria Posted: Updated: By Sheena McKenzie, Tamara Qiblawi and Fred Pleitgen CNN \nDAMASCUS, Syria (CNN) -- Dozens of Syrians were killed and hundreds of others were affected by a suspected chemical attack on the last rebel-held town in Eastern Ghouta, rescue workers and an aid group said Sunday. \nAnti-government activists claimed Syrian military helicopters dropped barrel bombs filled with chemicals on Douma, east of the capital Damascus, on Saturday night, suffocating some residents and sending others into violent convulsions. \nGraphic footage shot by rescuers and activists show people -- including children -- dead and injured, some ghostly white and foaming at the mouth in makeshift medical centers. Others were found suffocated in their homes, according to first responders. \nOn Sunday the Syrian government and Russia, its key ally, vehemently denied involvement and accused rebels in Douma of fabricating the chemical attack claims in order to hinder the army's advances and provoke international military intervention. \nUS President Donald Trump has been briefed on the attack, a White House official told ABC News on Sunday. The State Department described the incident as \"horrifying\" and said that if the use of chemical agents in the attack was confirmed, it would \"demand an immediate response by the international community.\" \nAt least 48 people died and 500 others displayed symptoms similar to exposure to \"toxic gas\" in the Douma area on Saturday, said the White Helmets rescue group and the Syrian American Medical Society, a charity, in a joint statement on Sunday. \nOther groups have announced varying death tolls in the wake of the attack. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the footage or the reports. \nFollowing the attack on Saturday night, doctors in Eastern Ghouta saw patients convulsing and some who appeared to be paralyzed and unresponsive, an official with the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM) told CNN. \nThe official, who asked to be identified as Dr. Jad and is in touch with local doctors, said one of the affected areas was the residential area of Masaken, where hundreds of civilians reside in underground shelters. \nSyrian army poised to retake Douma \nThe attack comes as Syrian forces are on the verge of recapturing Douma, the last town held by rebels in Eastern Ghouta, following a brutal offensive launched in mid-February. \nSources close to the Syrian army told CNN that the military had advanced nearly a kilometer into the Douma area on Saturday. \nOn Sunday the government said it was negotiating with Jaish al-Islam, the last remaining rebel group in Douma, to evacuate its fighters from the town to Jarablus in northern Syria, the state-run news agency SANA reported. \nTalks between Russia and the rebel group collapsed on Friday. The Syrian government later resumed airstrikes in the rebel-held town, killing scores of people. Rebels responded with mortar attacks on Damascus, killing at least 12 people. \nHundreds of people have been killed and thousands more wounded in the offensive on Eastern Ghouta, which was once home to an estimated 400,000. \nAround 130,000 people have left the enclave in the past month, according to the United Nations. Of these, 83,000 have gone to eight collective shelters in government-controlled areas on the outskirts of Damascus. \nMany have also fled to Idlib in the northwest, the largest remaining rebel-held area in the country. \nUnderground weapons factory? \nThe Syrian military took CNN to what it claimed was an underground weapons factory belonging to rebels in Eastern Ghouta. Inside they showed off chemicals, fuses and mortar casings they said were used by rebels to manufacture weapons. \nGovernment officials also showed CNN a handwritten manual detailing instructions for how to build incendiary weapons, including white phosphorus munitions, amongst other things. Officials say the manual was left behind by the rebels. \nAt another site, the military showed an underground storage facility they say belonged to the rebels inside a civilian area. The facility included an SA-5 surface-to-air missile. \nCNN could not independently verify these claims. \nOne year after Khan Sheikhoun \nThe Syrian regime has been accused many times of turning chemical weapons on its people over the course of the war. \nIn April 2017, more than 80 people were killed in a sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. \nThat attack prompted the United States to launch 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase. \nA joint report from the United Nations and international chemical weapons inspectors last October determined Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government was responsible for the attack. Damascus denied it was behind the attack and has repeatedly denied it has any chemical weapons. \nSaturday's attack comes amid uncertainty about what role, if any, the US will play in Syria in the future. \nThe US has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, where they advise local forces fighting ISIS. President Trump has said he wants to bring American troops home, but last week agreed to keep them in Syria for the short-term to help defeat the terror group. \nTamara Qiblawi and Fred Pleitgen reported from Damascus, Sheena McKenzie wrote in London.

Rory McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, reacts after making a birdie putt on the 18th hole during the third round at the Masters golf tournament Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Augusta, Ga. \nBy MARK LONG \nAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - It's essentially a Ryder Cup rematch at Augusta National. \nPatrick Reed and his par-5 prowess versus Rory McIlroy and his penchant for clutch shots. \nA 27-year-old American seeking his first major championship versus a 28-year-old Irishman chasing golf history. \nReed and McIlroy are forever linked to that singles match two years ago, which Reed won on the 18th hole. The personalities are unchanged. The events, and the stakes, are entirely different. \nThe crowd figures to be equally loud, just not as obnoxious. \n\"There's a lot of stuff that you can do at a Ryder Cup that you can't do at Augusta National,\" Reed said with a smile. \nDon't look for McIlroy to cup his hand over his ear to encourage the gallery to scream even louder. Or for Reed to point at McIlroy if he pulls off a clutch moment. \nBesides, it's stroke play. Reed had a three-shot lead. And it wasn't just about them. \n\"It's definitely not a two-horse race at this point,\" McIlroy cautioned. \"There's a lot more guys. I told myself today, leaderboards are huge here; it's hard to miss them. But I said to myself, 'Don't concentrate on them too much. Try not to look at them.' It's hard not to. \n\"I'll obviously know what Patrick Reed is doing, but apart from that, I'm going to set myself a target, try to get to that and hopefully it's enough.\" \nMcIlroy should hope he hasn't used up all his luck . He shot a 7-under 65 in the third round Saturday to match his lowest score at the Masters, pushing him within three shots of Reed and into the final pairing. \nHe chipped one in from 23 yards away for an eagle at the par-5 eighth. He saved par at the 13th after knocking his ball into a thick patch of pink azaleas. McIlroy watched an errant tee shot at the final hole ricochet back into the fairway, setting up a birdie that could have easily been a bogey. \n\"I rode my luck a little bit out there\" Saturday. McIlroy said. \"Hopefully I don't have to rely on it too much\" Sunday. \nThis is the fourth straight year that McIlroy arrived at Augusta National looking to complete the career Grand Slam - a feat accomplished by only five of the game's greatest players. \nThe last three times, he was simply too far back to make a Sunday run at the green jacket. \nThis time, it's within reach, though he'll have to chase down a guy who's carded three straight rounds in the 60s. \n\"I feel like all the pressure is on him,\" McIlroy said. \"He's got that to deal with and sleep on tonight.\" \nReed surely will bank on more par-5 dominance. He's played the course's longest holes at 13 under this week, better than anyone else in the field. \nReed ran off three straight birdies around the turn and stretched his lead with two eagles on the back nine. \nKeeping it won't be easy, not on this stage. Reed also doesn't buy into the idea that the pressure is all on him, a notion McIlroy quickly suggested. \n\"I am leading,\" he said. \"At the same time, he's going for the career Grand Slam.\" \n___ \nHere are some other things to know heading into the final round: \nALSO IN THE MIX \nRickie Fowler and Jon Rahm both matched McIlroy for the best score of the tournament with a 7-under 65. \nThey've still got a lot of work to do. \nFowler is five shots off the lead , while Rahm is another stroke back. Like Reed, both are seeking their first major title. \n\"Obviously it's been everyone's dream to win the Masters,\" Fowler said. \"To be able to have that chance to walk up 18 with a chance to win, or maybe you have it closed out and that's your walk to victory.\" \nOnly eight players are within eight shots of the lead, which is the largest 54-hole deficit that a Masters winner has ever come back from. Jack Burke Jr. did it in 1956. \nFADING AWAY \nJustin Thomas and Jordan Spieth were among the favorites coming into the week, but neither made a move on Moving Day. \nBoth are nine shots back after Thomas shot 70 and Spieth 71 on a soggy day with prime scoring conditions. \n\"I get to go out for one of my only stress-free rounds that I've ever really played at Augusta National,\" Spieth said. \nOUT OF THE RUNNING \nFour-time winner Tiger Woods turned in his best round of the week , but he was merely an afterthought after shooting a 72 that left him 18 shots behind Reed. \nPhil Mickelson plodded to a 74 and was a staggering 21 shots behind going to the final day. Only one player, 55-year-old Vijay Singh, has a higher 54-hole score than Mickelson's 223. \nMARKER RETURNS \nSpeaking of Singh, he shot an ugly 79 that put him in the first group of the final round. \nOfficially, he's playing by himself, but club champion Jeff Knox will tag along as a non-competing marker. \nKnox played Saturday with Paul Casey, who credited his partner with helping him shoot a 69. \n\"He's very good,\" Casey said. \"That was the best experience I've ever had with a marker.\" \nWEATHER FORECAST \nAfter periods of heavy rain Saturday, the forecast for the final round is more promising: Partly sunny skies with a slight chance of showers, and afternoon highs in the lower 60s. \n___ \nFor more AP golf coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Golf and https://apnews.com/tag/TheMasters   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

Jon Rahm, of Spain, hits a drive on the 18th hole during the third round at the Masters golf tournament Saturday, April 7, 2018, in Augusta, Ga. \nAUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) - Legendary sports writer and author Dan Jenkins talks about Ben Hogan winning the first Masters he ever covered in 1951, and how things have changed at Augusta National - particularly the greens. \nJenkins tells \"AP Sports Special Events\" podcast co-hosts Jim Litke and Tim Dahlberg that he always got along with Hogan, who was also from the Ft. Worth, Texas, area, and was along for the ride as Hogan won in 1951 and 1953. \nJenkins also talks about thinking Ken Venturi, not Arnold Palmer, was going to be the next big star in golf. He said Palmer had a better game than he thought, and the magnetism that took golf into a new era when he won the Masters in 1958 and 1960. \nHe also tells the hosts that his other love in sports is college football, and talks about the greatest games and greatest athletes he's seen. \nIt's the 67th Masters for Jenkins, who recalls the scratchy yet fast greens from the 1950s as well as the Quonset hut that the press used to cover the tournament from. \nAlso joining the podcast is AP Golf Writer Doug Ferguson, who talks about the possibilities on Sunday of Patrick Reed winning his first Masters and Rory McIlroy becoming only the sixth golfer to win the career Grand Slam. \nThe three engage in some food chat, too, and talk about the caffeine habit that had Litke drinking six shots of espresso on the short car ride to the golf course Saturday.

(Liam Richards/The Canadian Press via AP). A memorial at the stairs that lead to Elgar Petersen Arena is shown in Humboldt, Saskatchewan, on Saturday, April 7, 2018. \nBy JEREMY HAINSWORTH and ROB GILLIESAssociated Press \nHUMBOLDT, Saskatchewan (AP) - A hockey arena became the epicenter of grief for a small Canadian town on Sunday, as friends and relatives gathered to mourn 15 people killed after a semi-trailer slammed into a bus carrying a youth hockey team in western Canada. \nFourteen were also injured, some critically, in a collision that left a country, its national sport and the hockey-obsessed town of Humboldt, Saskatchewan reeling. \nThe bus had 29 passengers, including the driver, when it crashed at about 5 p.m. Friday on Highway 35, police said. Among the dead are Broncos head coach Darcy Haugan, team captain Logan Schatz and radio announcer Tyler Bieber. \nResidents of this town of less than 6,000 have been leaving flowers, team jerseys and personal tributes on the steps of the arena's entrance, forming a makeshift memorial. One tribute included a Kraft dinner box, which was a favorite meal of deceased forward Evan Thomas. A bouquet of pink roses adorned the box, which read \"to Evan, game day special, love your billet brother and sister Colten and Shelby.\" \nCanadians have become mourners as they have learned more about the identities of the deceased on the bus that was driving the Humboldt Broncos hockey team to a crucial playoff game Friday against the Nipawin Hawks. \nForward Jaxon Joseph, who is the son of former NHL player Chris Joseph, along with forward Logan Hunter and defensemen Stephen Wack, Adam Herold and Xavier Labelle were among the dead, according to family members and others. Bus driver Glen Doerksen and stats keeper Brody Hinz, who was 18, were also killed. \nHerold, who would have turned 17 on Thursday, played for the Regina Pat Canadians hockey team until just weeks ago, but was sent to join the Broncos for their playoff round when the Pat Canadians' season wrapped up, said John Smith, the Pat Canadians' manager. \nThe names of all the dead and injured have not been released by police. \n\"It's small town anywhere. We're devastated,\" said hockey club Vice President Randolph MacLEAN. \"At the center of this, we have 15 souls who'll never go home again. We have 29 lives that will never be the same.\" \nCanadian police said the truck driver, who was not hurt, was initially detained but has since been released and provided with mental health assistance. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Assistant Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said it's too early to state a cause for the crash. \n\"An entire country is in shock and mourning,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. \"To the entire Humboldt community: We are here for you. As neighbors, as friends, and as Canadians, we grieve alongside you.\" \nIn a tweet, President Donald Trump said he called Trudeau to offer his condolences to the families of victims. \nHassan Masri, an emergency room doctor at Saskatoon's Royal University Hospital who has done work in war-torn Syria, said the crash reminded him of an airstrike. \nPhotographs of the wreckage showed the twisted trailer with most of its wheels in the air and the bus on its side with its back portion destroyed. The force of the crash sent both vehicles into the ditch at the northwest corner of the intersection. \nAerial footage showed the roof of the bus peeled back and its front end destroyed. The trailer of the truck lay nearby in a shattered mess, with bags of its peat moss cargo scattered all around. The tractor part of the truck was intact, lying on its passenger side. \nThe tractor-trailer would have had to yield to a stop sign before crossing over the highway that the hockey bus was travelling on. There is a stand of trees on the southeast corner of the intersection, limiting visibility of the approach on both roads. \nPolice said a lot of issues have to be investigated, including weather conditions at the time and any mechanical issues with the vehicles. \nThe tragedy brought to mind an accident in 1986, when the Swift Current Broncos team bus slid off an icy highway and crashed in late December, killing four players. \nIt also brought Canadians to tears in a country where hockey is a way of life. \nThe Broncos are a close-knit team who dyed their hair blond for the playoffs. While most of the players were from elsewhere in western Canada, they were put up by families in the small town of Humboldt. \nA vigil will be held on the hockey team's home ice on Sunday night, and a makeshift stage and hundreds of chairs sit ready for the memorial. \n\"We're all hurting,\" said hockey arena cook Diane Sawatzky. \"We've become like a family and try to help each other.\" \nEarlier in the weekend, Humboldt Mayor Rob Muench, wearing a green and yellow Broncos team jersey, hugged people as they came to the Elger Petersen Arena in the Saskatchewan town to comfort each other and learn more. \n\"It's overwhelming. It's been tough on everybody,\" Muench said. \"We're a small community; some of those kids have been on the team for a number of years. A lot grew up in the community and everybody knows each other.\" \nMultiple crisis workers were assisting relatives and friends. \nThe Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League is a junior 'A' hockey league under Hockey Canada, which is part of the Canadian Junior Hockey League. It's open to North American-born players between the ages of 16 and 20. \nMichelle Straschnitzki, who lives in Airdrie, Alberta, said her 18-year old son Ryan was transported to a hospital in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. \n\"We talked to him, but he said he couldn't feel his lower extremities so I don't know what's going on,\" she said. \"I am freaking out. I am so sad for all of the teammates and I am losing my mind.\" \n___ \nGillies reported from Toronto.  ",

Erick Kiptanui from Kenya is on his way to win the Berlin Half-Marathon race in Berlin, Germany, Sunday, April 8, 2018. \nBy KIRSTEN GRIESHABERAssociated Press \nBERLIN (AP) - Six people were detained in connection with what police and prosecutors allege was a plan to carry out an attack on Berlin's half-marathon Sunday, German authorities said. \n\"There were isolated indications that those arrested, aged between 18 and 21 years, were participating in the preparation of a crime in connection with this event,\" prosecutors and police wrote in a joint statement. \nBerlin police tweeted that six people were detained in cooperation with the city's prosecutor's office. \nThe German daily Die Welt first reported that police foiled a plot to attack race spectators and participants with knives. \nThe main suspect allegedly knew Anis Amri, a Tunisian who killed 12 people and injured dozens more when he drove a truck into a Christmas market in Berlin in December 2016, Die Welt reported. \nOne of the apartments Berlin police raided before the race started Sunday was also searched after the Christmas market attack, the newspaper said. \nSpecial police forces detained four men in connection with the race plot, the paper said - different from the six that police reported. \nDie Welt reported that the main suspect, who was not identified, had prepared two knives to use in the attack. It also wrote that in one of the searched apartments, dogs trained to find explosives barked when they were taken into the dwelling's basement. \nThe local daily Tagesspiegel reported that the main suspect had been under observation for two weeks around the clock. After a foreign intelligence service tipped off German authorities that he was planning to attack the half-marathon, police raided apartments and two vehicles in the Charlottenburg and Neukoelln districts of the city. \nThe half-marathon was being guarded by some 630 police officers, German news agency dpa reported.

(AP) - The Latest on Sunday's final round of the Masters (all times local): \n12:20 p.m. \nTiger Woods is playing his final round at this Masters - and it may have included his best iron shot of the week. \nWoods nearly aced the 240-yard, par-3 fourth Sunday. His tee shot landed a few feet short of the flag, bounced a few times and then skirted by the left edge of the hole. He was left with a left-to-right-breaking 10-footer that he dropped in the left side of the cup. \nIt provided a brief glimpse of what might have been at Augusta National had Woods had better distance control with his irons. \nWoods missed greens right and left, never really getting approach shots in the perfect spots on treacherous greens. \nHis errant ways left him starting a lot sooner than expected and will have him finishing shortly after the leaders tee off Sunday afternoon. \nWoods also made a birdie on par-5 second, but followed that with bogey on the par-4 third. He is 3-over for the tournament. \n___ \nIt's essentially a Ryder Cup rematch at Augusta National. \nPatrick Reed and his par-5 prowess versus Rory McIlroy and his penchant for clutch shots. \nA 27-year-old American seeking his first major championship versus a 28-year-old Irishman chasing golf history. \nReed and McIlroy are forever linked to that singles match two years ago, which Reed won on the 18th hole. The personalities are unchanged. The events, and the stakes, are entirely different. \nThe crowd figures to be equally loud, just not as obnoxious. \n\"There's a lot of stuff that you can do at a Ryder Cup that you can't do at Augusta National,\" Reed said with a smile. \nDon't look for McIlroy to cup his hand over his ear to encourage the gallery to scream even louder. Or for Reed to point at McIlroy if he pulls off a clutch moment. \nBesides, it's stroke play. Reed had a three-shot lead. And it wasn't just about them. \nKeeping the lead won't be easy for Reed, not on this stage. But he doesn't buy into the idea that the pressure is all on him, a notion McIlroy quickly suggested. \n\"I am leading,\" he said. \"At the same time, he's going for the career Grand Slam.\" \n___ \nFor more AP golf coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/apf-Golf and https://apnews.com/tag/TheMasters Copyright 2018 The Associated Press.

CREDIT: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images By Sheena McKenzie, Tamara Qiblawi and Fred Pleitgen CNN \nDAMASCUS, Syria (CNN) -- US President Donald Trump warned Sunday of a \"big price to pay\" in Syria after a suspected chemical attack on the last rebel-held town in Eastern Ghouta left scores dead and injured. \nDozens of Syrians were killed and hundreds of others were affected by the attack on Douma, on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, rescue workers and an aid group said Sunday. \nAnti-government activists claimed Syrian military helicopters dropped barrel bombs filled with chemicals on the town on Saturday night, suffocating some residents and sending others into violent convulsions. \nGraphic footage shot by rescuers and activists show people -- including children -- dead and injured, some ghostly white and foaming at the mouth in makeshift medical centers. Others were found suffocated in their homes, according to first responders. \nOn Sunday the Syrian government and Russia, its key ally, vehemently denied involvement and accused rebels in Douma of fabricating the chemical attack claims in order to hinder the army's advances and provoke international military intervention. \nTrump on Sunday described the attack as \"SICK\" and criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \n\"Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. \n\"Big price to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK!\" \nTrump also blamed his predecessor for failing to act on previous chemical attacks in Syria. \n\"If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!\" Trump tweeted. \nSaturday's attack occurred almost a year to the day after the United States struck a Syrian airfield in response to a chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. \nThe State Department described the incident in Douma as \"horrifying\" and said that if the use of chemical agents in the attack was confirmed, it would \"demand an immediate response by the international community.\" \nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement Sunday that \"any use of chemical weapons, if confirmed, is abhorrent, and requires a thorough investigation.\" \nAt least 48 people died and 500 others displayed symptoms similar to exposure to \"toxic gas\" in the Douma area on Saturday, said the White Helmets rescue group and the Syrian American Medical Society, a charity, in a joint statement on Sunday. \nOther groups have announced varying death tolls in the wake of the attack. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the footage or the reports. \nFollowing the attack on Saturday night, doctors in Eastern Ghouta saw patients convulsing and some who appeared to be paralyzed and unresponsive, an official with the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM) told CNN. \nThe official, who asked to be identified as Dr. Jad and is in touch with local doctors, said one of the affected areas was the residential area of Masaken, where hundreds of civilians reside in underground shelters. \nState TV: Deal reached to evacuate Douma rebels \nThe attack comes as Syrian forces are on the verge of recapturing Douma, the last town held by rebels in Eastern Ghouta, following a brutal offensive launched in mid-February. \nOn Sunday, Syrian state TV reported that the government had reached an agreement with Jaish al-Islam, the last remaining rebel group in Douma, to leave the enclave in the next 48 hours. \nAs part of the agreement, the group's fighters would be transported to Jarablus in northern Syria. In exchange, the rebels would release all prisoners they are holding in Douma. \nJaish Al-Islam didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for confirmation. \nTalks between Russia and the rebel group collapsed on Friday. The Syrian government later resumed airstrikes in the rebel-held town, killing scores of people. Rebels responded with mortar attacks on Damascus, killing at least 12 people. \nSources close to the Syrian army told CNN that the military had advanced nearly a kilometer into the Douma area on Saturday. \nHundreds of people have been killed and thousands more wounded in the offensive on Eastern Ghouta, which was once home to an estimated 400,000. \nAround 130,000 people have left the enclave in the past month, according to the United Nations. Of these, 83,000 have gone to eight collective shelters in government-controlled areas on the outskirts of Damascus. \nMany have also fled to Idlib in the northwest, the largest remaining rebel-held area in the country. \nTurkey, which earlier this year launched its own military offensive against Kurdish groups in Afrin, northern Syria, said in a statement Sunday that countries with leverage over the Syrian regime had an obligation to help \"prevent future war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria.\" \nUnderground weapons factory? \nThe Syrian regime has long accused rebel groups of launching chemical attacks in the country, and last week the Syrian military took CNN to what it claimed was an underground weapons factory belonging to rebels in Eastern Ghouta. Inside they showed off chemicals, fuses and mortar casings they said were used by rebels to manufacture weapons. \nGovernment officials also showed CNN a handwritten manual detailing instructions for how to build incendiary weapons, including white phosphorus munitions, amongst other things. Officials say the manual was left behind by the rebels. \nAt another site, the military showed an underground storage facility they say belonged to the rebels inside a civilian area. The facility included an SA-5 surface-to-air missile. \nCNN could not independently verify these claims. \nOne year after Khan Sheikhoun \nThe Syrian regime has been accused many times of turning chemical weapons on its people over the course of the war. \nIn April 2017, more than 80 people were killed in a sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. \nThat attack prompted the United States to launch 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase. \nA joint report from the United Nations and international chemical weapons inspectors last October determined that Assad's government was responsible for the attack. Damascus denied it was behind the attack and has repeatedly denied it has any chemical weapons. \nSaturday's attack comes amid uncertainty about what role, if any, the US will play in Syria in the future. \nThe US has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, where they advise local forces fighting ISIS. President Trump has said he wants to bring American troops home, but last week agreed to keep them in Syria for the short-term to help defeat the terror group. \nTamara Qiblawi and Fred Pleitgen reported from Damascus, Sheena McKenzie wrote in London.

      "text": "A year after the US attacked Syria, what's changed? Posted: Updated: By Susannah Cullinane and Holly Yan CNN \n(CNN) -- One year ago the US launched its first military assault against the Syrian regime, a move some thought would be a game-changer in that country's gruesome civil war. \nUS warships pummeled a government airbase with missiles on April 6, 2017, a day after more than 80 Syrians died in a ghastly chemical attack. \nPhotos surfaced of dead children, their eyes wide open. US President Donald Trump said he took action in response because that chemical attack \"crossed a lot of lines for me.\" \nFast forward one year, and the horrors inside Syria haven't stopped. Children still fear death on a daily basis. And on Saturday, another suspected chemical attack killed dozens of people in the rebel-held city of Douma. \nHere's what's changed since the US assault last year, what hasn't changed and what could happen next: \nUN says Syrian regime was responsible for 2017 chemical attack \nWhat's happened: A joint report from the United Nations and international chemical weapons inspectors found that the Syrian regime was responsible for the April 2017 sarin attack that killed more than 80 people. \nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime maintains it had nothing to do with the attack. The government also insists it doesn't even have chemical weapons. \nIn February, a State Department spokeswoman said the US was \"extremely concerned about yet another report of the use of chlorine gas by the Syrian regime to terrorize citizens\" in eastern Ghouta -- the third reported incident in the region in the previous 30 days. \nNo one has claimed responsibility for the most recent attack Saturday, and the Syrian regime again denies any involvement. But anti-government activists say Syrian military helicopters dropped barrel bombs filled with chemicals on Douma, suffocating some residents and sending others into violent convulsions. \nWhat's next: On Sunday, Trump warned there will be a \"big price to pay\" over the latest reported chemical attack -- but didn't specify what that price would be. \nAssad regime makes gains \nWhat's happened: In the past year, the Syrian regime, supported by Russia and Iran, has gained more control over rebel-held areas, dampening the hopes of those who want to oust Assad and his autocratic rule. \nThe bloody battles have raged since 2011, when civilians turned into rebels trying to end four decades of rule by the Assad family. \nRebels now control little territory in Syria. Eastern Ghouta has been under siege since 2012, but the Syrian military has moved through the area since February. That offensive has been carried out with the support of Russia and in defiance of a UN call for a ceasefire. \nWhat's next: Idlib is now the only remaining Syrian province fully controlled by rebel groups. But Idlib has also been bombarded, and its fate remains uncertain. \nDeath toll tops 400,000 \nWhat's happened: More than 400,000 people have died since the civil war began in 2011, according to UN estimates. That's more than the entire population of New Orleans. \nAnd the suffering isn't limited to victims of airstrikes and gruesome barrel bomb attacks. In 2018 alone, more than half a million people have been displaced in and around Eastern Ghouta, Idlib and Afrin, said the UN humanitarian adviser for Syria, Jan Egeland. \n\"This is the very wrong time to turn our back on Syria's civilians,\" Egeland said. \nMany of those killed are children. In March, UNICEF regional communications chief Juliette Touma said 432 children had been killed and 803 injured in the first two months of 2018. \nWhat's next: Aid agencies are struggling to meet the needs of wounded and dying civilians. On Saturday, Doctors Without Borders (Medecins Sans Frontieres) said medical facilities supported by the group have received more than 1,000 dead and 4,800 wounded in Eastern Ghouta since the start of the renewed Syrian government assault from February 18 to March 4. \nBut the group acknowledges the numbers \"underestimate\" the casualties, since they don't include data from all MSF-supported medical clinics in the area nor facilities outside of its scope. \nISIS suffers big losses \nWhat's happened: ISIS managed to gain a strong foothold in Syria during the early years of the civil war, while the country was in chaos. But more recently ISIS has suffered significant blows. \nIn October 2017, US-backed militias declared the \"total liberation\" of the Syrian city of Raqqa, which was ISIS' de facto capital in Syria for three years. \nWhat's next: While Trump said the US would soon have total victory over ISIS, US defense officials have recently ackowledged that progress against ISIS has been largely halted due to Turkey's recent military incursion into Afrin, Syria -- an operation that has caused US-backed Kurdish fighters to divert from the ISIS fight. \nTurkey, a NATO ally, launched an operation targeting Kurdish groups in Afrin province in January to clear the border area of militias it considers to be terrorist organizations. \nTrump says he wants to get troops out of Syria \nWhat's happened: The US announced in December that there are about 2,000 American troops in Syria, supporting local forces fighting ISIS. \nWhat's next: Trump said last month that after helping deal blows to ISIS, US troops will start coming home \"very soon.\" \n\"We're knocking the hell out of ISIS,\" he said on March 29. \"We'll be coming out of Syria, like, very soon. Let the other people take care of it now.\" \nTM &© 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved. Search Local Businesses ",

      "text": "Hockey community grieves after 15 killed in bus crash involving - KTVQ.com | Q2 | Continuous News Coverage | Billings, MT Member Center: Hockey community grieves after 15 killed in bus crash involving Canadian junior hockey team Posted: Updated: Emergency crews block the highway on April 7, 2018, near the area where a bus carrying a junior hockey team to a playoff game was struck by a semi, north of Tisdale, Saskatchewan, Canada. By Ralph Ellis, Dakin Andone and Carma Hassan CNN \n(CNN) -- A small town in Canada's Saskatchewan province is in mourning Saturday after 15 people died when a bus carrying a junior hockey team collided with a tractor-trailer. At least 14 are being treated for injuries. \n\"This is a dark moment for our city, our community, our province,\" Humboldt Mayor Rob Muench said Saturday afternoon at a news conference. \"There is no playbook on what to do in cases like this. \nThe crash occurred around 5 p.m. Friday north of Tisdale, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as the team was headed for the town of Nipawin for a playoff game. RCMP Assistant Commissioner Curtis Zablocki said the tractor-trailer, traveling west on Highway 335, collided with the bus which was traveling north on Highway 35. \nThree of the injured are in critical condition, according to the RCMP. Authorities have yet to identify the victims. Twenty-nine people were on the bus. \nThe driver of the tractor-trailer was not injured in the collision, Zablocki said. He was initially detained but was later released, and he is not currently the subject of a criminal investigation. \n\"Our investigators will be looking at all aspects of this accident to determine what took place,\" Zablocki said. \"It's too early to comment on the cause of the collision.\" \nThe Humboldt team was scheduled to play the Nipawin Hawks in the fifth game of a best-of-seven semifinal playoff series Friday. The teams played a lengthy game Wednesday that Nipawin won 6-5 in three overtimes in Humboldt, leaving Nipawin with a 3-1 series lead. \nPain felt far and wide \nThe tragedy was felt across Canada, where hockey is the dominant sport and many young players take long bus rides to tournaments. \nExpressions of support poured in, much of them focused on a Twitter photo that showed three injured players grasping each other's hands while lying in hospital beds. \nHumboldt, a town of about 6,000, has a long tradition of fielding teams in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League. \nThe Broncos, like other teams in the league, attract players from different parts of Canada who stay with host families during the hockey season, the team's website said. According to an online team roster, players range in age from 16 to 21 and many are from Saskatchewan, with two from Humboldt. Others hail from the province of Alberta. \n\"Our Broncos family is in shock as we try to come to grips with our incredible loss,\" Kevin Garinger, the team's president, said in a statement. \nFriday's crash brought back memories of another highway accident that claimed the lives of hockey players in Saskatchewan. In 1986, four members of the Swift Current Broncos of the Western Hockey League died in a crash in the western part of the province, CNN partner CBC reported. \nNHL, Trudeau offer condolences \nMembers of the National Hockey League expressed sadness over the news. \n\"We sent condolence, comfort and strength to all affected by the devastating crash involving the Humboldt Broncos' team bus,\" the National Hockey League said on Twitter. \nCam Talbot, a goalie for the Edmonton Oilers in the NHL, tweeted: \"After all the hours spent on a bus with the boys over the years this one really hits home. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and communities affected by this horrible tragedy. #PrayersForHumboldt\" \n\"I can't imagine being the parent or the wife or the kids at home going through something like this,\" Toronto Maple Leafs coach Mike Babcock said at a press conference. \"It hurts.\" \nOn Saturday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau offered his condolences on Twitter. \n\"I cannot imagine what these parents are going through, and my heart goes out to everyone affected by this terrible tragedy, in the Humboldt community and beyond,\" Trudeau tweeted. \nUS President Donald Trump also expressed sympathy for the victims' families on Twitter. \nDonations pour in \nThe hockey community and others rallied around the victims and their families after news of the crash, offering financial assistance. \nBy Sunday morning, a GoFundMe page for the players and their families had raised more than $3.2 million, the result of nearly 50,000 donations. \nMany of those donations purportedly came from the hockey community. NHL teams like the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Pittsburgh Penguins gave money, as did hockey equipment manufacturer Bauer Hockey, which shared a link to the GoFundMe on its Twitter account. \nMuench said it will take a long time for Humboldt to recover. \n\"We're a small town and we're overwhelmed with the outpouring of condolences we've received,\" he said. \"We're asking for everyone's support and consideration in the coming days and weeks and months and years it will take us to get through this.\"? \nCNN's Amanda Jackson, Nicole Chavez, Artemis Moshtaghian, Jason Hanna and Tina Burnside contributed to this report. \nTM &© 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

CREDIT: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images By Sheena McKenzie, Tamara Qiblawi and Fred Pleitgen CNN \nDAMASCUS, Syria (CNN) -- As images spread of children gasping and convulsing, aid groups and international leaders are denouncing the Syrian regime for their alleged role in a suspected chemical attack. \nMore than 70 people were reportedly killed Saturday in Douma, the last rebel-held town in Eastern Ghouta, the International Rescue Committee said Sunday. \n\"The evidence points towards yet another chemical attack by the regime,\" said Maja Kocijancic, spokeswoman for European Union Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. \n\"Almost a year to the day of the horrific attacks in Khan Sheikhoun, it is a matter of grave concern that chemical weapons continue to be used, especially on civilians.\" \nThe International Rescue Committee said the latest incident \"only serves to further demonstrate that the government of Syria will stop at nothing to win this war.\" \nBut the Syrian government and its key ally Russia vehemently denied involvement in Saturday's attack. \nInstead, they accused rebels in Douma of fabricating the chemical assault claims in order to hinder the army's advances and provoke international military intervention. \nIran, another ally, also defended the Syrian regime. \n\"The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly condemns the use of such (chemical) weapons by any party and anywhere in the world,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi told the state-run Islamic Republic News agency. \nHe said the allegation that the Syrian regime is behind the attack \"is not compatible with reality.\" \nBut anti-government activists claimed Syrian military helicopters dropped barrel bombs filled with chemicals on the town, suffocating some residents and sending others into violent convulsions. \nGraphic footage shot by rescuers and activists show victims -- including children -- dead and injured, some ghostly white and foaming at the mouth in makeshift clinics. Others were found suffocated in their homes, according to first responders. \nAt least 48 people died and 500 others displayed symptoms similar to exposure to \"toxic gas\" in the Douma area, the White Helmets rescue group and the Syrian American Medical Society charity group said in a joint statement. \nOther groups have announced varying death tolls in the wake of the attack. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the footage or the reports. \nUS President Donald Trump described the attack as \"SICK\" and criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iran for supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \n\"Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria,\" Trump wrote on Twitter. \"Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. \n\"Big price to pay. Open area immediately for medical help and verification. Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. SICK!\" \nTrump also blamed his predecessor for failing to act on previous chemical attacks in Syria. \n\"If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!\" Trump tweeted. \nSaturday's attack occurred almost a year to the day after the United States struck a Syrian airfield in response to a chemical attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. \nThe State Department described the incident in Douma as \"horrifying\" and said that if the use of chemical agents in the attack was confirmed, it would \"demand an immediate response by the international community.\" \nThe US, United Kingdom, France, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Kuwait, Peru and Cote d'Ivoire have called an emergency UN Security Council meeting to discuss the reported chemical weapon attack. That meeting is expected Monday, the UK mission to the UN said. \nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement Sunday that \"any use of chemical weapons, if confirmed, is abhorrent, and requires a thorough investigation.\" \nFollowing the attack on Saturday night, doctors in Eastern Ghouta saw patients shaking uncontrollably and some who appeared to be paralyzed and unresponsive, an official from the Union of Medical Care and Relief Organizations (UOSSM) told CNN. \nThe official, who asked to be identified as Dr. Jad, is in touch with local doctors and said one of the affected areas was the residential area of Masaken, where hundreds of civilians reside in underground shelters. \nState TV: Deal reached to evacuate Douma rebels \nThe attack comes as Syrian forces are on the verge of recapturing Douma, the last town held by rebels in Eastern Ghouta, following a brutal offensive launched in mid-February. \nOn Sunday, Syrian state TV reported that the government had reached an agreement with Jaish al-Islam, the last remaining rebel group in Douma, to leave the enclave in the next 48 hours. \nAs part of the agreement, the group's fighters would be transported to Jarablus in northern Syria. In exchange, the rebels would release all prisoners they are holding in Douma. \nJaish Al-Islam didn't immediately respond to CNN's request for confirmation. \nTalks between the rebel group and Russia collapsed on Friday. The Syrian government later resumed airstrikes in the rebel-held town, killing scores of people. Rebels responded with mortar attacks on Damascus, killing at least 12 people. \nSources close to the Syrian army told CNN that the military had advanced nearly a kilometer into the Douma area on Saturday. \nHundreds of people have been killed and thousands more wounded in the offensive on Eastern Ghouta, which was once home to an estimated 400,000. \nAround 130,000 people have left the enclave in the past month, according to the United Nations. Of these, 83,000 have gone to eight collective shelters in government-controlled areas on the outskirts of Damascus. \nMany have also fled to Idlib in the northwest, the largest remaining rebel-held area in the country. \nTurkey, which earlier this year launched its own military offensive against Kurdish groups in Afrin, northern Syria, said in a statement Sunday that countries with leverage over the Syrian regime had an obligation to help \"prevent future war crimes and crimes against humanity in Syria.\" \nUnderground weapons factory? \nThe Syrian regime has long accused rebel groups of launching chemical attacks in the country, and last week the Syrian military took CNN to what it claimed was an underground weapons factory belonging to rebels in Eastern Ghouta. Inside they showed off chemicals, fuses and mortar casings they said were used by rebels to manufacture weapons. \nGovernment officials also showed CNN a handwritten manual detailing instructions for how to build incendiary weapons, including white phosphorus munitions, amongst other things. Officials say the manual was left behind by the rebels. \nAt another site, the military showed an underground storage facility they say belonged to the rebels inside a civilian area. The facility included an SA-5 surface-to-air missile. \nCNN could not independently verify these claims. \nOne year after Khan Sheikhoun \nThe Syrian regime has been accused many times of turning chemical weapons on its people over the course of the war. \nIn April 2017, more than 80 people were killed in a sarin gas attack on the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. \nThat attack prompted the United States to launch 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase. \nA joint report from the United Nations and international chemical weapons inspectors last October determined that Assad's government was responsible for the attack. Damascus denied it was behind the attack and has repeatedly denied it has any chemical weapons. \nSaturday's attack comes amid uncertainty about what role, if any, the US will play in Syria in the future. \nThe US has about 2,000 troops in Syria, where they advise local forces fighting ISIS. President Trump has said he wants to bring American troops home, but last week agreed to keep them in Syria for the short-term to help defeat the terror group. \nTamara Qiblawi and Fred Pleitgen reported from Damascus, and Sheena McKenzie wrote in London. CNN's Hamdi Alkhshali, Holly Yan, Steve Almasy and Milena Veselinovic contributed to this report. \nTM &© 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company. All rights reserved.

George said she and a female friend asked him to stop. She said her friend has epilepsy and worried the noise would trigger a seizure. \nGeorge said no one in the group knew the man, but they had seen him downtown before. \n\"He has been down here before with the bullhorn, but usually he uses it\" to talk, George said. \nAfter being told to stop, the man immediately pulled out a knife and tried to stab her and her friend, George said. George, who is pregnant, said the blade came within inches of her stomach. As the two dodged the man, George said, he threw his bike at them and other members in the group. \n\"He pulled his knife out of his pocket and when he couldn't get us with the knife, he threw his bike at us. And that's when my family members and friends tried to stop him,\" George said. \nFour men in her group rushed the suspect. One of her friends was stabbed in the stomach and two in their arms, she said. The suspect stabbed himself in the abdomen accidentally, George said. After the fight, another member of the group held the suspect until police arrived, she said. \n\"I was really scared,\" George said. \"I thought I was going to get stabbed.\"   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

(AP) - A magnitude 4.6 earthquake shook Oklahoma on Saturday and was also felt in neighboring Kansas and Missouri, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. \nIt was one of four earthquakes recorded in northwest Oklahoma on Saturday morning. Garfield County Emergency Management Director Mike Honigsberg said there are no immediate reports of injury or serious damage following the quakes. \nThe largest temblor was at 7:16 a.m. a few miles outside Covington, a town of about 500 people. Reports on the USGS website show it was felt as far away as Kansas City, Missouri, some 300 miles (480 kilometers) northeast of Covington. People in Joplin, Missouri, and Wichita, Kansas, also reported feeling it. \nSaturday's quakes were in the same area where four others struck Friday, including one of magnitude 3.7. \nThe threshold for damage usually starts at 4.0. The strongest earthquake on record in Oklahoma was a magnitude 5.8 recorded near Pawnee in September 2016. \nMany of the thousands of earthquakes in Oklahoma in recent years have been linked to the underground injection of wastewater from oil and natural gas production. State regulators have directed several producers to close or reduce volumes in some wells.

(AP) - A gun openly carried by a spectator at a school concert in 2015 has turned into a major legal case as the Michigan Supreme Court considers whether the state's public schools can trump the Legislature and adopt their own restrictions on firearms. \nThe case from Ann Arbor has been on the court's docket for more than a year. But arguments set for Wednesday are getting extra attention in the wake of a Florida school shooting in February that killed 17. \nThere's no dispute that Michigan law bars people from possessing a gun inside a weapon-free school zone. But there's a wrinkle: Someone with a concealed pistol permit can enter school property with a gun that's openly holstered. \nThough rare, it happened three years ago at a choir concert at Ann Arbor Pioneer High School, scaring teens, staff and spectators. The school board responded by banning all guns, with exceptions for police. \n\"If a student were to bring a gun into a school, that would be worthy of an expulsion,\" said Jeanice Kerr Swift, superintendent of Ann Arbor schools. \"So why would it be different for other folks? ... What this case is about is local communities having a choice.\" \nSeparately, the Clio district, north of Flint, has a similar policy. The Supreme Court is hearing challenges from gun owners in both communities. \nGun-rights advocates argue that local governments, including elected school boards, can't step into an area reserved for the Michigan Legislature under state law. They point to a Lansing-area library whose ban on the open display of guns was struck down by the state appeals court in 2012. \nBut in Ann Arbor and Clio, another three-judge panel at the appeals court said schools are in a different category and have freedom to further restrict guns. The districts won that round. \nKen Herman, a paramedic and gun-owning parent who sued the Clio district, believes the appeals court got it wrong. In a filing at the Supreme Court, his attorney said schools have a duty to keep students safe, but lawmakers have \"chosen to reserve the power to regulate the possession of firearms.\" \nHerman, 36, said he carries a gun for protection wherever it's allowed. He said fears would be eased if more adults educated kids about proper gun ownership. \n\"If adults are OK with it, there are no alarm bells,\" Herman said. \"If they overreact and yell 'fire' every time a law-abiding citizen is carrying, they're sending the wrong message.\" \nHe said many Clio parents with gun permits would be willing to volunteer at schools and add an extra layer of security. \n\"If something were to happen and I didn't possess the tools to intercept to some degree, I'm not sure I could live with that burden,\" Herman said. \nStudents are paying attention to the cases. Paige Tar, a junior at Northville High School in suburban Detroit, is part of a statewide student group, Engage 18, which favors giving schools authority over guns. She said she's been involved in stressful discussions over what to do during a shooting. \n\"My point is the school is turned into some sort of sick war game where the goal is to survive,\" Tar said. \nThe state's highest court has allowed outside groups to file briefs, including the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The Washington-based group said Michigan schools must have the power to set safety policies. \nBut another organization, the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Ownership, said schools must cede some ground to the Legislature. \n\"Firearm possession, and the right of self-defense that is inseparable from it, demand uniform treatment,\" the group said. \n___ \nFollow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwhiteap   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

Downtown San Francisco saw nearly 2 inches (5 centimeters) on Friday, making for the fourth-wettest April day since record-keeping began. \nThe storm tapered off by late Saturday morning but minor flooding continued along the swollen Truckee River near Lake Tahoe. Yosemite National Park's Yosemite Valley remained closed Saturday night, but officials said they would assess whether to reopen midday Sunday, depending on conditions. \nNo major problems were reported, but runoff from melting snow could add to the chance of rapidly rising streams and rivers, forecasters warned. \nThe wet weather resulted from a strong \"atmospheric river\" of subtropical moisture that moved east from Hawaii. \nPolice rescued a man who became trapped in a rain-swollen drainage channel near Sacramento, where many roads were flooded. The state capital saw more than 1.17 inches (nearly 3 centimeters) of rain on Friday. \nSonoma County officials said there were no major mudslides in areas stripped bare by last fall's wildfires. \nSan Francisco International Airport reported about 150 canceled flights because of the weather and others were delayed. \nTo the north, state officials warned this week that they may have to use the partially rebuilt spillway at Oroville Dam for the first time since repairs began on the badly damaged structure last summer. \nThe water level in Lake Oroville topped 797 feet (243 meters) on Saturday.

He says such animosity is \"harmful to our country.\" \nOn ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" on April 2, Kimmel prodded the first lady's reading of a children's book at the White House Easter egg hunt. He mocked the accent of the first lady, who was born in Slovenia. \nHannity took exception. The two exchanged barbs through the week. \nKimmel says he hopes Hannity will \"continue his newly-found advocacy for women, immigrants and First Ladies.\" \nHannity says he'll address Kimmel's statement on his Monday show.

A firefighter looks out from the window of a damaged apartment in Trump Tower in New York on Saturday, April 7, 2018. The Fire Department says the blaze broke out on the 50th floor shortly before 6 p.m. Saturday. \nBy KAREN MATTHEWSAssociated Press \nNEW YORK (AP) - The man killed in a blaze at New York City's Trump Tower was an art collector who spent time with Andy Warhol, but fell on hard financial times in recent years and went through bankruptcy proceedings. \nTodd Brassner, 67, died on Saturday at a hospital after a fire tore through his 50th-floor apartment in the high-rise, which was constructed at a time when building codes did not require the residential section to have sprinklers. \nThe city's Department of Buildings said Sunday the building did have working hard-wired smoke detectors, and that the fire department was first notified of the blaze by the detectors in the building's heating and ventilation system. A cause had not yet been determined. \nBrassner, who records show bought his unit in 1996, is mentioned several times in Warhol's posthumously published diaries, with references including lunch dates and shared taxis. The artist signed and dedicated at least one print to him. \nBut in recent years, Brassner came upon money difficulties. According to documents, his family had stopped helping him pursue buying and selling art at the end of 2014, and in the last few years he had been \"plagued with debilitating medical problems that have made it difficult for him to function.\" \nThe fire sent thick, black smoke pouring from the windows of the skyscraper that bears the president's name. \nNew York Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro said the apartment was \"virtually entirely on fire\" when firefighters arrived. \nFire sprinklers were not required in New York City high-rises when Trump Tower was completed in 1983. Subsequent updates to the building code required commercial skyscrapers to install the sprinklers retroactively, but owners of older residential high-rises are not required to install sprinklers unless the building undergoes major renovations. \nSome fire-safety advocates pushed for a requirement that older apartment buildings be retrofitted with sprinklers when New York City passed a law requiring them in new residential highrises in 1999, but officials in the administration of then-mayor Rudy Giuliani said that would be too expensive. \nTrump was among the developers who spoke out against the retrofitting as expensive and unnecessary. \nNo member of the Trump family was in the 664-foot tower on Saturday. \nTrump's family has an apartment on the top floors of the 58-story building, but he has spent little time in New York since taking office. The headquarters of the Trump Organization is on the 26th floor.

(AP) - A body was recovered Saturday in the vicinity where an SUV plunged off a Northern California cliff last month, killing a family of eight in what authorities suspect may have been an intentional crash. \nThe Mendocino County Sheriff's office said in a statement that a couple vacationing along the coast saw a possible body, which was pulled from the surf Saturday afternoon by a third bystander. \nThe body appears to be that of an African American female, but the age and identity could not immediately be determined, said Lt. Shannon Barney. An autopsy is planned Tuesday to determine a cause of death. \nWhile authorities said they believe the body may be that of one of two missing girls from the crash, positive identification will most likely be done by DNA analysis, which could take weeks. \nSarah and Jennifer Hart and their six adopted children were believed to be in the family's SUV when it plunged off a cliff last month. Five bodies were found March 26 near Mendocino, a few days after Washington state authorities began investigating the Harts for possible child neglect, but three of their children were not immediately recovered from the scene. \nThere were no signs of the other two children, authorities said Saturday. \nAuthorities have said that data from the vehicle's software suggested the crash was deliberate. They said the SUV had stopped at a coastal highway overlook before speeding straight off the cliff and plummeting 100 feet (31 meters) into the rocky Pacific Ocean below. \nSarah Hart pleaded guilty in 2011 to a domestic assault charge in Minnesota over what she said was a spanking given to one of her children. \nBruce and Dana DeKalb, the family's next-door neighbors in Woodland, Washington, called child welfare officials last month because the couple's 15-year-old son, Devonte, had been coming to their house almost every day for a week, asking for food. They said the teen claimed his parents were \"punishing them by withholding food.\" \nDevonte, a black boy who is still missing, drew national attention after he was photographed in tears while hugging a white police officer during a 2014 protest. \nThe discovery of the body Saturday follows a two-day storm that swept through Northern California. \nThe sheriff's office noted that it is not uncommon after a significant storm that items would surface or wash onto the beach. \n\"The Mendocino County Sheriff's Office is monitoring the ocean conditions to see when further searches might be safely conducted,\" Barney said. \"This evaluation includes the use of divers if conditions permit.\"   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

Pictures shows characters Aech, left, and Parzival in a scene from \"Ready Player One,\" a film by Steven Spielberg. \nBy AP Film Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - John Krasinski's \"A Quiet Place\" made a thunderous debut at the box office, opening with $50 million in ticket sales and rumbling to the year's second-best weekend after \"Black Panther,\" according to studio estimates Sunday. \nThe Paramount Pictures thriller far exceeded expectations to land one of the top opening weekends for a horror release. It marks an unlikely breakthrough for Krasinski, the former \"Office\" star many associate more with inter-office romance and deadpan expressions than silent cinematic frights. Krasinski's third directing effort, which stars himself and wife Emily Blunt is about a family in a future dystopia populated by violent creatures with extremely acute hearing. \nBut it was far from the only success story on the weekend, which also saw Universal's R-rated comedy \"Blockers\" open solidly with $21.4 million, Steven Spielberg's virtual-reality adventure \"Ready Player One\" dip only 40 percent with $25.1 million in its second weekend and the period docudrama \"Chappaquiddick\" beat expectations with a debut of $6.2 million. In limited release, Wes Anderson's \"Isle of Dogs,\" Lynne Ramsay's \"You Were Never Really Here\" and Andrew Haigh's \"Lean on Pete\" all did well, too. \nFor one weekend, at least, just about everything Hollywood could throw at moviegoers worked. The weekend was up 35.3 percent from last year. \nBut nothing approached the runaway success of \"A Quiet Place.\" Hollywood had forecast closer to $30 million for the film, which cost just $17 million to make. Yet \"A Quiet Place\" rode strong buzz from its SXSW premiere in March, good reviews (97 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and moviegoers' continuing thirst for horror. \n\"We always knew we had something special from the first screenings. But you don't get to a number like this without breaking free of the genre. I think this is about great storytelling,\" said Kyle Davies, head of domestic distribution for Paramount, who heaped praise on Krasinski. \"We're looking forward to what else he has up his sleeve.\" \n\"A Quiet Place\" is also a badly needed hit for Paramount, which has struggled mightily at the box office in recent years while its ownership has sometimes been in limbo. Earlier this week, CBS Corp. submitted a bid to acquire Viacom Inc., Paramount's parent company. \nThough greenlit under the previous leadership, \"A Quiet Place\" is the first major success under Jim Gianopulos, who took over as studio head a year ago. The opening is Paramount's biggest since 2016's \"Star Trek Beyond\" and its best non-franchise opening since 2013's \"World War Z.\" \n\"Blockers\" also heralds a filmmaking breakthrough aided by an enthusiastic response from SXSW audiences. The film, which cost about $21 million to make, is the directorial debut of Kay Cannon, a writer whose credits include \"30 Rock\" and \"Pitch Perfect.\" ''Blockers,\" starring Leslie Mann, John Cena and Ike Barinholtz as parents trying to prevent their daughters from losing their virginity, shrugged off a recent slump for comedies in theaters. \n\"Kay Cannon knocked it out of the park,\" said Jim Orr, distribution head for Universal, who credited Cannon with inverting the \"double standards\" of the teen sex comedy. \"We could not be more pleased.\" \nDespite the competition, Warner Bros.' \"Ready Player One\" held well, bringing its domestic total to $96.9 million. But it's fared even better overseas, where Spielberg's latest has already grossed $294.4 million. It's done especially well in China, where the film has made $161.3 million in two weeks. \nContinuing ticket sales also pushed Ryan Coogler's \"Black Panther\" further into the record books. The Marvel blockbuster now ranks third all-time domestically with $665.4 million, trailing only \"Avatar\" and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" Over the weekend, \"Black Panther\" passed 1997's \"Titanic,\" which grossed $659.4 million, though accounting for inflation would put it above $1 billion. \nJohn Curran's \"Chappaquiddick,\" about the 1969 Ted Kennedy scandal, opened with $6.2 million in 1,560 theaters. The film, starring Jason Clarke as Kennedy, was acquired by Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios at last fall's Toronto International Film Festival. Originally planned for an awards season release, the move to spring seemed to give \"Chappaquiddick\" a better chance to stand out. \nIn its third weekend, Fox Searchlight's \"Isle of Dogs\" grossed $4.6 million in 554 theaters. LD Entertainment's \"The Miracle Season,\" about an inspirational season for a girls' high-school volleyball team, opened with $4.1 million. \nWith one of the best per-theater performances of the year, Amazon's \"You Were Never Really Here,\" starring Joaquin Phoenix, opened with $129,911 in three theaters. A24's \"Lean on Pete,\" with Charlie Plummer, debuted with $50,118 on four screens. \n\"Everyone kind of won this weekend,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. \"This is the kind of weekend that Hollywood should try to recreate over and over again. The diversity of the lineup and the originality of the films drove huge numbers of moviegoers to the multiplex.\" \nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers also are included. Final three-day domestic figures will be released Monday. \n1. \"A Quiet Place,\" $50 million ($21 million international). \n2. \"Ready Player One,\" $25.1 million ($81.7 million international). \n3. \"Blockers,\" $21.4 million ($3.2 million international). \n4. \"Black Panther,\" $8.4 million ($4.5 million international). \n5. \"I Can Only Imagine,\" $8.4 million. \n6. \"Tyler Perry's Acrimony,\" $8.1 million. \n7. \"Chappaquiddick,\" $6.2 million. \n8. \"Sherlock Gnomes,\" $5.6 million ($2.7 million international). \n9. \"Pacific Rim Uprising,\" $4.9 million ($12.4 million international). \n10. \"Isle of Dogs,\" $4.6 million ($1.1 million international). \n___ \nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at international theaters (excluding the U.S. and Canada), according to comScore: \n1. \"Ready Player One,\" $81.7 million. \n2. \"A Quiet Place,\" $21 million. \n3. \"Peter Rabbit,\" $19.2 million. \n4. \"Pacific Rim Uprising,\" $12.4 million. \n5. \"Hindi Medium,\" $11.7 million. \n6. \"Tomb Raider,\" $4.9 million. \n7. \"Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum,\" $4.9 million. \n8. \"What a Man Wants,\" $4.7 million. \n9. \"Baaghi 2,\" $4.6 million. \n10. \"Black Panther,\" $4.5 million. \n___ \nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of John Krasinski's last name in three references. \n___ \nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

The university has acquired a trove of photos capturing a place and time la... \nBy JEFF KAROUBAssociated Press \nDETROIT (AP) - A striking, sepia-toned picture recently acquired by the University of Michigan jumps out from the past and begs to tell a story: A man dressed in a heavy coat and hat is as big as the cabin door whose knob he is reaching to turn and enter. \nThe picture is labeled simply, \"Big Jim.\" \nThe rare photo is among 30 acquired by the Bentley Historical Library last year from a private donor that capture a place and time often overlooked by history: black Civilian Conservation Corps camps in Michigan and elsewhere during the Great Depression. The photos are the only known images of the state's segregated, all-black camps. President Franklin Roosevelt established the corps in the early 1930s, offering shelter, clothing, food and wages to a \"vast army\" of unemployed men who worked to conserve and restore national resources. \nAs the people and stories behind the pictures are increasingly lost to time, the university posted them online and launched a public call for information. So far, Big Jim's story is the only one that's been filled in, thanks to people who knew him and responded: He was James Richardson, a quiet, strong, hard-working rural Michigan farmer who served in World War I and went on to join the CCC. \nFor the archivists, it represents delayed but welcome recognition for the contributions of workers who faced discrimination and marginalization during a dark economic era. \n\"What I liked about the photographs is they show that these young guys were doing work on parks, trails, out in the woods - way away from their homes,\" said Morris Thomas, who as a child knew Richardson and identified him for Michigan researchers after seeing his image in a state history magazine. \"It is something unique; there aren't that many photos available.\" \nEighty-five years after the Civilian Conservation Corps' creation, any cache of this kind is a boon to historians. Photographs from designated black camps are far less common than from white camps. Thomas, now 75, says his family also had photos of an uncle who worked in a black camp but laments, \"Now we can't find them.\" \nDespite the legacy of segregation, the photos and stories they conjure reveal elements of unexpected egalitarianism and advancement. \n\"That was a tremendous thing for black people,\" said Thomas' cousin Frank Thomas, who as a boy often spent time with Richardson and neighborhood friends. \"There were really no jobs for black people at that time, only menial jobs. All those guys got a chance to ... show people they can work and can do anything anybody else can do.\" \nCCC camps initially were integrated, according to the university, but became segregated by 1935 amid community protests. Out of Michigan's roughly 150 camps, some 16 were designated for black men. Black membership was capped at 10 percent of the overall corps, which numbered around 3 million over the course of the program. \nThe Michigan History Center says the state's black camps helped build a ski area and contributed to efforts to plant millions of trees, fight forest fires, construct bridges and buildings, and establish public campgrounds. \n\"The CCC camps did tremendous things to better the community for both black and white people,\" Frank Thomas said. \"Put in playgrounds, all that stuff.\" \nJoan Sharpe, president of the Civilian Conservation Corps Legacy, said the segregation in the camps reflected U.S. society at the time. Still, she added, that doesn't erase the opportunities it provided for people of all races. \n\"The guys I've talked to that were in the CCC camps that were black were very grateful ... to have access to education, access to vocational training, learn how to lay stone, build roads - things they would not have had before,\" said Sharpe, whose group serves and supports CCC alumni. \n\"I have to look at it from their perspective,\" she added. \"Their story and station in life would be very different than us looking back on it and saying, 'Oh, how awful.'\" \nAfter leaving the CCC, Richardson continued his hard-working ways, according to Thomas and his cousin. He tended to his 40-acre (16-hectare) farm in Manistee County and did odd jobs such as cutting logs and hauling pulpwood to a paper mill. Local legend has it that he once lifted a Model A for someone with a flat tire and once attached a plow to himself to take over for a stubborn horse. He died in 1959 at age 65. \nFrank Thomas, 79, believes \"Big Jim\" served \"as a big ambassador for black people,\" and can still be for people who see his picture and hear his story. \n\"You'd think of a man that size he would be aggressive, but I never heard tell or saw any indication of that,\" he said. \"That goes long way in race relations and community relations.\" \n___ \nJeff Karoub is a member of AP's Race and Ethnicity Team.

At the same time, the three states on the southern end of Tornado Alley are experiencing extreme and exceptional drought that could fuel wildfires. \nTornado Alley extends from northern Texas and covers much of Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and South Dakota, plus slivers of New Mexico and Colorado, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Storm Prediction Center. \nThe past three years, the U.S. has seen an average of more than 600 tornadoes during April, May and June, according to the center . That is more than half the average of 1,186 tornadoes per year during that time span, although the numbers from the last three months of 2017 are still considered preliminary. \nKansas, Oklahoma and Texas are accustomed to preparing for multiple emergency situations happening at once and train with various agencies to account for different possibilities. \n\"We're typically preparing for worst-case scenarios year-round anyway,\" state Department of Emergency Management spokeswoman Keli Cain said, noting that the SPC reports Oklahoma City has been struck by more tornadoes than any other U.S. city, with more than 100 known twisters. \"We do have some experience at that. We plan for all hazards anyway.\" \nKatie Horner, spokeswoman for the Kansas adjutant general's division of emergency management, said last year the state dealt with a blizzard, an ice storm, fire, flooding and a tornado warning all in the same week. \"We train not only for one or two events in a day, but three or four events in a day,\" she added. \nChip Orton, the emergency management director for Amarillo, a city of about 200,000 in the Texas Panhandle, says, \"My job is to be worried.\" \n\"That's why we come to work every day. Is it likely? Probably not. Could it happen? Sure,\" he said. \nWhile tornadoes are the result of thunderstorms, which are created from conditions that include moisture, the current dry conditions in the area do not preclude twisters, said Storm Prediction Center meteorologist Patrick Marsh. He noted that two tornadoes were reported in the Texas Panhandle on March 18, even as the area was rated in extreme drought. \nSome private forecasting services are predicting an increase in tornadoes during the coming months, based largely on the fact that there was the climate phenomenon La Nina during the past winter. They're expecting weather patterns in the coming months to be wetter and warmer than usual, particularly in the southeastern U.S. and along the Gulf Coast. \n\"(Those conditions) would be a petri dish for thunderstorms. You need to add an additional ingredient for tornados. ... You need wind shear. Wind shear is best described as a change in wind speed and direction,\" Marsh said, and is created when cold air and warm air collide at the surface. \nThe national Storm Prediction Center, however, does not forecast severe weather more than about a week in advance. \n___ \nFollow Ken Miller on Twitter at https://twitter.com/KenMiller7   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

These undated arrest photos made available by the Shreveport Police Department show Corey Williams under arrest. Defense attorneys are urging the nation's highest court to throw out a case in which they claim Louisiana... \nBy MICHAEL KUNZELMANAssociated Press \nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) - A legal team has petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its claim that Louisiana prosecutors withheld evidence for a murder trial that ended in a guilty verdict against an intellectually disabled teenager accused of killing a pizza deliveryman. \nCorey Williams was 16 years old when police arrested him in the shooting death of Jarvis Griffin two decades ago in Caddo Parish, where prosecutors have been widely criticized for their aggressive approach to seeking the death penalty. \nEarlier this week, a group of 44 former prosecutors and Justice Department officials - former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey among them - filed a brief in support of a petition by Williams' lawyers asking the court to review and reverse his murder conviction. \nBefore the shooting, Williams was hospitalized for extreme lead poisoning, still sucked his thumb and frequently urinated on himself, according to his lawyers. A district court judge overturned Williams' death sentence in 2004 on the basis of his disabilities, one of his attorneys said. \nLawyers for Williams say there wasn't any physical evidence linking him to the January 1998 death of Griffin, who was killed and robbed while delivering a pizza to a Shreveport home. \nThe petition claims \"staggering\" evidence of Williams' innocence was suppressed by prosecutors before his trial. \nCaddo Parish prosecutors haven't filed a response to the petitions yet, but they have denied violating their duty to disclose evidence favorable to Williams. \nWitnesses saw several older men steal money and pizza from Griffin and saw Williams running from the house alone with nothing in his hands after the shooting, according to his lawyers. One of the older men, Chris Moore, was the only witness who identified Williams as the shooter. \nFingerprints found on the murder weapon belonged to one of the other older men, and the victim's blood was found on clothing worn by a third older man, according to Williams' lawyers. \nPolice officers found Williams hiding under a sheet on a couch at his grandmother's house. He initially denied killing Griffin but changed his story after police questioned him through the night. \n\"His confession was brief, devoid of corroborating details,\" his lawyers wrote in their March 2 petition to the Supreme Court. \"Having just assumed responsibility for a homicide, Corey told the officers, 'I'm tired. I'm ready to go home and lay down.'\" \nWilliams' lawyers say his conviction was based primarily on that confession and the testimony of Moore. Only after Williams' trial did his attorneys obtain recordings of witness interviews pointing to his innocence. The withheld recordings showed police had suspected the older men were plotting to frame Williams for the killing, according to Williams' lawyers. \nSupreme Court justices expressed concern about the suppression of evidence in a different Louisiana case it decided in 2012. The court voted 8-1 to reverse a conviction in a case in which New Orleans prosecutors similarly withheld a witness statement from the night of a murder because they decided it wouldn't alter the trial's outcome. \nDale Cox, Caddo Parish's former acting district attorney, said in a 2015 court filing that Williams hasn't proved the recorded witness statements contained \"exculpatory\" evidence or that withholding them deprived him of a fair trial. \n\"The State presented to the jury a confession that was wholly corroborated by eyewitness testimony,\" he wrote. \nCox, who once told a reporter he believes the state needs to \"kill more people,\" personally prosecuted one-third of the Louisiana cases that resulted in death sentences between 2010 and 2015, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. \nIn a 4-2 vote last October, the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to hold a hearing on Williams' claims. His attorneys are asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review that decision.

Al Sharpton on Saturday to announce a June rally in front of President Donald Trump's Manhattan apartment to protest gun violence eased by access to assault weapons. \nAalayah Eastmond, a junior at Stoneman Douglas High School, was at Sharpton's National Action Network in Harlem for the minister's weekly meetings. \nSixteen-year-old Eastmond was in class Feb. 14 when a gunman fired through a window, sparing her but eventually killing 17 people. \nThe June 2 rally - at the beginning of New York state's Gun Violence Awareness Month - is to start at Trump International Tower on Columbus Circle and proceed toward Fifth Avenue and Trump Tower, where Trump has an apartment that has been his longtime home. \nFor Eastmond, New York City is more than a prominent media staging ground. One of her family members was fatally shot here. \nFifteen years ago, \"I actually lost my uncle to gun violence in Brooklyn,\" she said. \"So for it to happen to me, in my face, that just shows that change has to happen now.\" \nSharpton said that young people leading recent activism across the country has produced what he called \"a necessary marriage of dealing with gun violence as an American issue that jumps over the boundaries of any community and deals with America from every city.\" \nAnother Sharpton concern is how police handle interactions with the mentally ill. On Thursday, police fatally shot a Brooklyn man, Saheed Vassell, as he brandished what turned out to be a welding torch mistaken for a gun. \nAmong the June rally organizers is Ramon Contreras, 19, a senior at one of 11 NYC College Prep charter schools who lost a classmate to gun violence last October. \n\"He was only 17 years old,\" Contreras said. \"The way it affected me, I was lost.\" \nHe said everybody wanted to do something, but felt \"we didn't have the resources.\" \nLast month, \"the nationwide walkout gave us the courage, and pretty much the strength to say, 'Hey, enough is enough.'\"   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

      "text": "Missouri governor's lawyer asks panel to delay probe report 2018-04-07T21:00:57Z \nBy MARGARET STAFFORDAssociated Press \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens' personal attorney is asking a state House committee investigating Greitens' actions during an extramarital affair to delay the release of its findings, saying an ongoing criminal investigation is likely to uncover information that will make the report inaccurate. \nIn a letter sent Friday to Republican Rep. Jay Barnes, chairman of the House investigatory committee, attorney Edward Dowd detailed what he said were several problems with the criminal investigation being conducted in St. Louis into allegations that the governor took a photo of a partially nude woman with whom he had an affair in 2015 without her consent. \nThe House committee is expected to release its finding in the coming week. \n\"We believe that your report will almost certainly contain information that will - in the course of the coming days and weeks - be publicly proven to be incorrect,\" Dowd wrote. \nDowd said a court motion filed by Democratic Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, who is leading the criminal investigation, prevents Greitens' attorneys from sharing information with the House committee. \nBarnes declined to comment on the letter Saturday. \nA St. Louis grand jury indicted Greitens in February on a felony invasion-of-privacy charge over the photo allegations. Greitens has acknowledged having the affair before he ran for governor but has denied any criminal wrongdoing. \nDowd said Greitens' legal team is confident that if the House had time to look \"at the full spectrum of facts\" it would conclude \"that this is a sham prosecution, and when it is subjected to the rigors of a criminal trial where testimony is subject to cross-examination, the Governor will be found innocent.\" \nThe woman involved in the affair was deposed by Greitens' legal team on Friday and her ex-husband is scheduled to meet with them on Monday. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported the woman was questioned for more than eight hours Friday. She has repeatedly declined interview requests from the media. \nDowd said the legal team believed the depositions would reveal inconsistencies and falsehoods in the information given to the grand jury and the media. \nDowd also warned Barnes that the lawmakers' investigation establishes a troubling legal precedent that would subject any elected official to investigation by other elected officials \"at any time, for any conduct - including private matters that took place years before they took office - on the basis of accusations promoted by the media, and they will then be subjected to an inquiry that has no standards of evidence and results in publication of materials that are deliberately one-sided.\"   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

The for-profit college industry is struggling under ... Graphic shows fall enrollment trends since 2014 at U.S. colleges by type; 2c x 5 1/2 inches; 96.3 mm x 139 mm; \nBy MARIA DANILOVA and RICHARD LARDNERAssociated Press \nWASHINGTON (AP) - The for-profit college industry is struggling under the weight of declining enrollment, stiff competition from traditional universities and an image battered by past misdeeds, even as the Trump administration tries to offer a helping hand. \nEducation Secretary Betsy DeVos has hired several industry insiders and frozen Obama-era regulations that would have increased protections for students. She has reduced loan forgiveness relief for some former students defrauded by their schools, meaning that the for-profit industry could be on the hook for less. And she is considering reinstating an ousted oversight agency for many for-profit colleges. \n\"There is a serious attempt by this department to find that appropriate fair balance for both students and schools,\" Steve Gunderson, president of Career Education Colleges and Universities, the industry lobbying group, said in an interview. \nBut Timothy Lutts, president of the Cabot Wealth Network in Salem, Massachusetts, sees an industry in decline. An improving economy has led to lagging enrollment as adult students return to the workplace instead of seeking a degree to burnish their resumes, he said. For-profit colleges now also compete with nonprofit schools that offer online degree programs without the stigma that still haunts money-making schools. \n\"It was a great sector a decade ago,\" Lutts said. \"For for-profit schools, the tide is still going out.\" \nStudent enrollment at most four-year for-profit colleges fell in 2017 to just over 901,000, down nearly 69,000 from the year before, according to data compiled by the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center. It's a downward trend that began in the fall of 2010. \nThe falling numbers have led to upheaval. \nAdtalem Global Education in December unloaded DeVry University by transferring ownership of the struggling school at no cost to a small for-profit education company in California. The move came a year after DeVry agreed to a $100 million settlement to resolve a Federal Trade Commission lawsuit alleging the school misled students through deceptive ads. \nCorinthian Colleges collapsed in 2015 and ITT Technical Institute a year later. \nDonald Trump's election as president had held the promise of heady times for the industry. After all, he was the founder of Trump University. \nAmong the DeVos hires are senior counselor Robert Eitel, who served as an attorney for Bridgepoint Education; Julian Schmoke, the top financial enforcement official, who once worked as an academic dean at DeVry; and Diane Auer Jones, who was hired as a senior policy adviser this month, used to lobby for Career Education Corporation, a major for-profit operator. \n\"What we have here is essentially an embrace of that industry by the Trump administration,\" said Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. \"If the concern is that a whole industry has been exploiting the situation, you wouldn't want any one from that industry being involved in any regulation, you would be skeptical.\" \nPaul Peterson, a professor of education at Harvard University, said DeVos' hiring decisions were not unusual. Historically, U.S. administrations have tended to fill many positions with people outside the government sector in order to bring new energy and perspective, with Democrats traditionally relying most on lawyers and academics, while Republicans picking industry practitioners. \n\"You don't want people running the government who don't know anything about the sector,\" Peterson said. \nEducation Department press secretary Liz Hill said individuals hired had long careers before and after their work in the for-profit sector. \"In addition to being highly qualified, they are carefully complying with all ethical requirements and have recused themselves when appropriate,\" Hill said in a statement. \nShe said DeVos was focused on expanding education options for students and that the schools' tax status was irrelevant to the quality of their education. \"The one question we should be asking is whether or not an education institution is serving students well, not how it filed paperwork with the IRS,\" Hill said. \nBut Erika Colon, a 35-year old mother of three in Boston, said the federal government should increase oversight and tighten controls of for-profit schools. Colon, 35, took out about $15,000 in loans to get a certificate as a medical administrative assistant at one of the Corinthian Colleges schools. She said she received a low-quality education, could not get a job and ended up retraining in a related field at a different school - only then getting hired by a hospital. \n\"They are just giving students high hopes for nothing and just taking people's money,\" Colon said. \nFor-profits had experienced a boom over the past two decades, buoyed by federal student funding and the global financial crisis that left many Americans without jobs and eager to go back to school to gain new skills and credentials. Enrollment rose from around 230,000 in the early 1990s to a record 2 million in 2010. \nThe schools recruited aggressively, often targeting nontraditional students - usually older people who had jobs and could only study part time. Schools focused heavily on women and people of color. They also pursued veterans with their millions in GI Bill tuition assistance. A 2017 federal study found that veterans represent a larger share of students at for-profit colleges compared with other schools. \nBut after graduating, many students struggled to find promised jobs or to transfer credits to other schools, leading to massive student loan defaults. An Education Department watchdog said in a report last month that the \"sector continues to present itself as a high-risk area for the department.\" \nWith the future uncertain, a growing number of schools are seeking to abandon the for-profit world by converting to nonprofit status. These transformations, which require approvals from state and federal regulators, mean less oversight and relief from a law that bars for-profits from receiving more than 90 percent of their revenue through federal student aid programs. \nAfter five straight years of losing revenue and students, Bridgepoint Education, the San Diego-based owner of two for-profit universities, announced last month that it intends to merge its schools into a single nonprofit called Ashford University. Bridgepoint will become what's known as an online program management company. These are the businesses that design, market and run the virtual programs that colleges offer to students. Pending the necessary approvals, Bridgepoint's first client would be Ashford University. \nNolan Sundrud, a Bridgepoint spokesman, attributed the overhaul to the rapidly evolving environment in which colleges and universities operate. \nConsumers should be wary of these proposed conversions, according to Bob Shireman, a former Education Department official during President Barack Obama's first term and a frequent critic of for-profit colleges. Shireman, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, a progressive Washington think tank, published a report in 2015 that warned of \"covert nonprofits\" that are free of regulatory burdens but continue to operate as for-profit schools. \nA group of Democratic senators has asked the Government Accountability Office to look into the conversions.

George said she and a female friend asked him to stop. She said her friend has epilepsy and worried the noise would trigger a seizure. \nGeorge said no one in the group knew the man, but they had seen him downtown before. \n\"He has been down here before with the bullhorn, but usually he uses it\" to talk, George said. \nAfter being told to stop, the man immediately pulled out a knife and tried to stab her and her friend, George said. George, who is pregnant, said the blade came within inches of her stomach. As the two dodged the man, George said, he threw his bike at them and other members in the group. \n\"He pulled his knife out of his pocket and when he couldn't get us with the knife, he threw his bike at us. And that's when my family members and friends tried to stop him,\" George said. \nFour men in her group rushed the suspect. One of her friends was stabbed in the stomach and two in their arms, she said. The suspect stabbed himself in the abdomen accidentally, George said. After the fight, another member of the group held the suspect until police arrived, she said. \n\"I was really scared,\" George said. \"I thought I was going to get stabbed.\"   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

(AP) - A gun openly carried by a spectator at a school concert in 2015 has turned into a major legal case as the Michigan Supreme Court considers whether the state's public schools can trump the Legislature and adopt their own restrictions on firearms. \nThe case from Ann Arbor has been on the court's docket for more than a year. But arguments set for Wednesday are getting extra attention in the wake of a Florida school shooting in February that killed 17. \nThere's no dispute that Michigan law bars people from possessing a gun inside a weapon-free school zone. But there's a wrinkle: Someone with a concealed pistol permit can enter school property with a gun that's openly holstered. \nThough rare, it happened three years ago at a choir concert at Ann Arbor Pioneer High School, scaring teens, staff and spectators. The school board responded by banning all guns, with exceptions for police. \n\"If a student were to bring a gun into a school, that would be worthy of an expulsion,\" said Jeanice Kerr Swift, superintendent of Ann Arbor schools. \"So why would it be different for other folks? ... What this case is about is local communities having a choice.\" \nSeparately, the Clio district, north of Flint, has a similar policy. The Supreme Court is hearing challenges from gun owners in both communities. \nGun-rights advocates argue that local governments, including elected school boards, can't step into an area reserved for the Michigan Legislature under state law. They point to a Lansing-area library whose ban on the open display of guns was struck down by the state appeals court in 2012. \nBut in Ann Arbor and Clio, another three-judge panel at the appeals court said schools are in a different category and have freedom to further restrict guns. The districts won that round. \nKen Herman, a paramedic and gun-owning parent who sued the Clio district, believes the appeals court got it wrong. In a filing at the Supreme Court, his attorney said schools have a duty to keep students safe, but lawmakers have \"chosen to reserve the power to regulate the possession of firearms.\" \nHerman, 36, said he carries a gun for protection wherever it's allowed. He said fears would be eased if more adults educated kids about proper gun ownership. \n\"If adults are OK with it, there are no alarm bells,\" Herman said. \"If they overreact and yell 'fire' every time a law-abiding citizen is carrying, they're sending the wrong message.\" \nHe said many Clio parents with gun permits would be willing to volunteer at schools and add an extra layer of security. \n\"If something were to happen and I didn't possess the tools to intercept to some degree, I'm not sure I could live with that burden,\" Herman said. \nStudents are paying attention to the cases. Paige Tar, a junior at Northville High School in suburban Detroit, is part of a statewide student group, Engage 18, which favors giving schools authority over guns. She said she's been involved in stressful discussions over what to do during a shooting. \n\"My point is the school is turned into some sort of sick war game where the goal is to survive,\" Tar said. \nThe state's highest court has allowed outside groups to file briefs, including the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence. The Washington-based group said Michigan schools must have the power to set safety policies. \nBut another organization, the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Ownership, said schools must cede some ground to the Legislature. \n\"Firearm possession, and the right of self-defense that is inseparable from it, demand uniform treatment,\" the group said. \n___ \nFollow Ed White at http://twitter.com/edwhiteap   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

Downtown San Francisco saw nearly 2 inches (5 centimeters) on Friday, making for the fourth-wettest April day since record-keeping began. \nThe storm tapered off by late Saturday morning but minor flooding continued along the swollen Truckee River near Lake Tahoe. Yosemite National Park's Yosemite Valley remained closed Saturday night, but officials said they would assess whether to reopen midday Sunday, depending on conditions. \nNo major problems were reported, but runoff from melting snow could add to the chance of rapidly rising streams and rivers, forecasters warned. \nThe wet weather resulted from a strong \"atmospheric river\" of subtropical moisture that moved east from Hawaii. \nPolice rescued a man who became trapped in a rain-swollen drainage channel near Sacramento, where many roads were flooded. The state capital saw more than 1.17 inches (nearly 3 centimeters) of rain on Friday. \nSonoma County officials said there were no major mudslides in areas stripped bare by last fall's wildfires. \nSan Francisco International Airport reported about 150 canceled flights because of the weather and others were delayed. \nTo the north, state officials warned this week that they may have to use the partially rebuilt spillway at Oroville Dam for the first time since repairs began on the badly damaged structure last summer. \nThe water level in Lake Oroville topped 797 feet (243 meters) on Saturday.

(AP) - A body was recovered Saturday in the vicinity where an SUV plunged off a Northern California cliff last month, killing a family of eight in what authorities suspect may have been an intentional crash. \nThe Mendocino County Sheriff's office said in a statement that a couple vacationing along the coast saw a possible body, which was pulled from the surf Saturday afternoon by a third bystander. \nThe body appears to be that of an African American female, but the age and identity could not immediately be determined, said Lt. Shannon Barney. An autopsy is planned Tuesday to determine a cause of death. \nWhile authorities said they believe the body may be that of one of two missing girls from the crash, positive identification will most likely be done by DNA analysis, which could take weeks. \nSarah and Jennifer Hart and their six adopted children were believed to be in the family's SUV when it plunged off a cliff last month. Five bodies were found March 26 near Mendocino, a few days after Washington state authorities began investigating the Harts for possible child neglect, but three of their children were not immediately recovered from the scene. \nThere were no signs of the other two children, authorities said Saturday. \nAuthorities have said that data from the vehicle's software suggested the crash was deliberate. They said the SUV had stopped at a coastal highway overlook before speeding straight off the cliff and plummeting 100 feet (31 meters) into the rocky Pacific Ocean below. \nSarah Hart pleaded guilty in 2011 to a domestic assault charge in Minnesota over what she said was a spanking given to one of her children. \nBruce and Dana DeKalb, the family's next-door neighbors in Woodland, Washington, called child welfare officials last month because the couple's 15-year-old son, Devonte, had been coming to their house almost every day for a week, asking for food. They said the teen claimed his parents were \"punishing them by withholding food.\" \nDevonte, a black boy who is still missing, drew national attention after he was photographed in tears while hugging a white police officer during a 2014 protest. \nThe discovery of the body Saturday follows a two-day storm that swept through Northern California. \nThe sheriff's office noted that it is not uncommon after a significant storm that items would surface or wash onto the beach. \n\"The Mendocino County Sheriff's Office is monitoring the ocean conditions to see when further searches might be safely conducted,\" Barney said. \"This evaluation includes the use of divers if conditions permit.\"   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

Pictures shows characters Aech, left, and Parzival in a scene from \"Ready Player One,\" a film by Steven Spielberg. \nBy AP Film Writer \nNEW YORK (AP) - John Krasinski's \"A Quiet Place\" made a thunderous debut at the box office, opening with $50 million in ticket sales and rumbling to the year's second-best weekend after \"Black Panther,\" according to studio estimates Sunday. \nThe Paramount Pictures thriller far exceeded expectations to land one of the top opening weekends for a horror release. It marks an unlikely breakthrough for Krasinski, the former \"Office\" star many associate more with inter-office romance and deadpan expressions than silent cinematic frights. Krasinski's third directing effort, which stars himself and wife Emily Blunt is about a family in a future dystopia populated by violent creatures with extremely acute hearing. \nBut it was far from the only success story on the weekend, which also saw Universal's R-rated comedy \"Blockers\" open solidly with $21.4 million, Steven Spielberg's virtual-reality adventure \"Ready Player One\" dip only 40 percent with $25.1 million in its second weekend and the period docudrama \"Chappaquiddick\" beat expectations with a debut of $6.2 million. In limited release, Wes Anderson's \"Isle of Dogs,\" Lynne Ramsay's \"You Were Never Really Here\" and Andrew Haigh's \"Lean on Pete\" all did well, too. \nFor one weekend, at least, just about everything Hollywood could throw at moviegoers worked. The weekend was up 35.3 percent from last year. \nBut nothing approached the runaway success of \"A Quiet Place.\" Hollywood had forecast closer to $30 million for the film, which cost just $17 million to make. Yet \"A Quiet Place\" rode strong buzz from its SXSW premiere in March, good reviews (97 percent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and moviegoers' continuing thirst for horror. \n\"We always knew we had something special from the first screenings. But you don't get to a number like this without breaking free of the genre. I think this is about great storytelling,\" said Kyle Davies, head of domestic distribution for Paramount, who heaped praise on Krasinski. \"We're looking forward to what else he has up his sleeve.\" \n\"A Quiet Place\" is also a badly needed hit for Paramount, which has struggled mightily at the box office in recent years while its ownership has sometimes been in limbo. Earlier this week, CBS Corp. submitted a bid to acquire Viacom Inc., Paramount's parent company. \nThough greenlit under the previous leadership, \"A Quiet Place\" is the first major success under Jim Gianopulos, who took over as studio head a year ago. The opening is Paramount's biggest since 2016's \"Star Trek Beyond\" and its best non-franchise opening since 2013's \"World War Z.\" \n\"Blockers\" also heralds a filmmaking breakthrough aided by an enthusiastic response from SXSW audiences. The film, which cost about $21 million to make, is the directorial debut of Kay Cannon, a writer whose credits include \"30 Rock\" and \"Pitch Perfect.\" ''Blockers,\" starring Leslie Mann, John Cena and Ike Barinholtz as parents trying to prevent their daughters from losing their virginity, shrugged off a recent slump for comedies in theaters. \n\"Kay Cannon knocked it out of the park,\" said Jim Orr, distribution head for Universal, who credited Cannon with inverting the \"double standards\" of the teen sex comedy. \"We could not be more pleased.\" \nDespite the competition, Warner Bros.' \"Ready Player One\" held well, bringing its domestic total to $96.9 million. But it's fared even better overseas, where Spielberg's latest has already grossed $294.4 million. It's done especially well in China, where the film has made $161.3 million in two weeks. \nContinuing ticket sales also pushed Ryan Coogler's \"Black Panther\" further into the record books. The Marvel blockbuster now ranks third all-time domestically with $665.4 million, trailing only \"Avatar\" and \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" Over the weekend, \"Black Panther\" passed 1997's \"Titanic,\" which grossed $659.4 million, though accounting for inflation would put it above $1 billion. \nJohn Curran's \"Chappaquiddick,\" about the 1969 Ted Kennedy scandal, opened with $6.2 million in 1,560 theaters. The film, starring Jason Clarke as Kennedy, was acquired by Byron Allen's Entertainment Studios at last fall's Toronto International Film Festival. Originally planned for an awards season release, the move to spring seemed to give \"Chappaquiddick\" a better chance to stand out. \nIn its third weekend, Fox Searchlight's \"Isle of Dogs\" grossed $4.6 million in 554 theaters. LD Entertainment's \"The Miracle Season,\" about an inspirational season for a girls' high-school volleyball team, opened with $4.1 million. \nWith one of the best per-theater performances of the year, Amazon's \"You Were Never Really Here,\" starring Joaquin Phoenix, opened with $129,911 in three theaters. A24's \"Lean on Pete,\" with Charlie Plummer, debuted with $50,118 on four screens. \n\"Everyone kind of won this weekend,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for comScore. \"This is the kind of weekend that Hollywood should try to recreate over and over again. The diversity of the lineup and the originality of the films drove huge numbers of moviegoers to the multiplex.\" \nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers also are included. Final three-day domestic figures will be released Monday. \n1. \"A Quiet Place,\" $50 million ($21 million international). \n2. \"Ready Player One,\" $25.1 million ($81.7 million international). \n3. \"Blockers,\" $21.4 million ($3.2 million international). \n4. \"Black Panther,\" $8.4 million ($4.5 million international). \n5. \"I Can Only Imagine,\" $8.4 million. \n6. \"Tyler Perry's Acrimony,\" $8.1 million. \n7. \"Chappaquiddick,\" $6.2 million. \n8. \"Sherlock Gnomes,\" $5.6 million ($2.7 million international). \n9. \"Pacific Rim Uprising,\" $4.9 million ($12.4 million international). \n10. \"Isle of Dogs,\" $4.6 million ($1.1 million international). \n___ \nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at international theaters (excluding the U.S. and Canada), according to comScore: \n1. \"Ready Player One,\" $81.7 million. \n2. \"A Quiet Place,\" $21 million. \n3. \"Peter Rabbit,\" $19.2 million. \n4. \"Pacific Rim Uprising,\" $12.4 million. \n5. \"Hindi Medium,\" $11.7 million. \n6. \"Tomb Raider,\" $4.9 million. \n7. \"Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum,\" $4.9 million. \n8. \"What a Man Wants,\" $4.7 million. \n9. \"Baaghi 2,\" $4.6 million. \n10. \"Black Panther,\" $4.5 million. \n___ \nThis story has been updated to correct the spelling of John Krasinski's last name in three references. \n___ \nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP   AP National News Video More>> Facebook: Most users may have had public data 'scraped' \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data \nFacebook's acknowledgement that nearly all of its 2.2 billion members have probably had their public data scraped by \"malicious actors\" is the latest example of the social media giant's failure to protect users' data Trump says he didn't know about payment to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels \nPresident Donald Trump says he didn't know about the $130,000 payment his personal attorney made to Stormy Daniels Dylan, Kesha change pronouns in songs to honor LGBTQ couples \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns \nBob Dylan, Kesha and St. Vincent have reimagined popular love songs to honor the LGBTQ community, and the singers are doing it by switching pronouns",

In a photo provided by the Bentley Historical Library, cooks of Free Soil Civilian Conservation Corps are photographed in 1935 in Michigan. The university has acquired a trove of photos capturing a place and time la... \nBy JEFF KAROUBAssociated Press \nDETROIT (AP) - A striking, sepia-toned picture recently acquired by the University of Michigan jumps out from the past and begs to tell a story: A man dressed in a heavy coat and hat is as big as the cabin door whose knob he is reaching to turn and enter. \nThe picture is labeled simply, \"Big Jim.\" \nThe rare photo is among 30 acquired by the Bentley Historical Library last year from a private donor that capture a place and time often overlooked by history: black Civilian Conservation Corps camps in Michigan and elsewhere during the Great Depression. The photos are the only known images of the state's segregated, all-black camps. President Franklin Roosevelt established the corps in the early 1930s, offering shelter, clothing, food and wages to a \"vast army\" of unemployed men who worked to conserve and restore national resources. \nAs the people and stories behind the pictures are increasingly lost to time, the university posted them online and launched a public call for information. So far, Big Jim's story is the only one that's been filled in, thanks to people who knew him and responded: He was James Richardson, a quiet, strong, hard-working rural Michigan farmer who served in World War I and went on to join the CCC. \nFor the archivists, it represents delayed but welcome recognition for the contributions of workers who faced discrimination and marginalization during a dark economic era. \n\"What I liked about the photographs is they show that these young guys were doing work on parks, trails, out in the woods - way away from their homes,\" said Morris Thomas, who as a child knew Richardson and identified him for Michigan researchers after seeing his image in a state history magazine. \"It is something unique; there aren't that many photos available.\" \nEighty-five years after the Civilian Conservation Corps' creation, any cache of this kind is a boon to historians. Photographs from designated black camps are far less common than from white camps. Thomas, now 75, says his family also had photos of an uncle who worked in a black camp but laments, \"Now we can't find them.\" \nDespite the legacy of segregation, the photos and stories they conjure reveal elements of unexpected egalitarianism and advancement. \n\"That was a tremendous thing for black people,\" said Thomas' cousin Frank Thomas, who as a boy often spent time with Richardson and neighborhood friends. \"There were really no jobs for black people at that time, only menial jobs. All those guys got a chance to ... show people they can work and can do anything anybody else can do.\" \nCCC camps initially were integrated, according to the university, but became segregated by 1935 amid community protests. Out of Michigan's roughly 150 camps, some 16 were designated for black men. Black membership was capped at 10 percent of the overall corps, which numbered around 3 million over the course of the program. \nThe Michigan History Center says the state's black camps helped build a ski area and contributed to efforts to plant millions of trees, fight forest fires, construct bridges and buildings, and establish public campgrounds. \n\"The CCC camps did tremendous things to better the community for both black and white people,\" Frank Thomas said. \"Put in playgrounds, all that stuff.\" \nJoan Sharpe, president of the Civilian Conservation Corps Legacy, said the segregation in the camps reflected U.S. society at the time. Still, she added, that doesn't erase the opportunities it provided for people of all races. \n\"The guys I've talked to that were in the CCC camps that were black were very grateful ... to have access to education, access to vocational training, learn how to lay stone, build roads - things they would not have had before,\" said Sharpe, whose group serves and supports CCC alumni. \n\"I have to look at it from their perspective,\" she added. \"Their story and station in life would be very different than us looking back on it and saying, 'Oh, how awful.'\" \nAfter leaving the CCC, Richardson continued his hard-working ways, according to Thomas and his cousin. He tended to his 40-acre (16-hectare) farm in Manistee County and did odd jobs such as cutting logs and hauling pulpwood to a paper mill. Local legend has it that he once lifted a Model A for someone with a flat tire and once attached a plow to himself to take over for a stubborn horse. He died in 1959 at age 65. \nFrank Thomas, 79, believes \"Big Jim\" served \"as a big ambassador for black people,\" and can still be for people who see his picture and hear his story. \n\"You'd think of a man that size he would be aggressive, but I never heard tell or saw any indication of that,\" he said. \"That goes long way in race relations and community relations.\" \n___ \nJeff Karoub is a member of AP's Race and Ethnicity Team.

FILE - In this June 16, 2017, file photo, Jimmy Kimmel attends the 30th annual Scleroderma Foundation Benefit at the Beverly Wilshire hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif. Kimmel has apologized for a joke about Mel... \nNEW YORK (AP) - Late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel has apologized for a \"silly\" joke about first lady Melania Trump's accent and moved to deescalate a feud with Fox News host Sean Hannity. \nKimmel said in a Twitter post made Sunday that his exchanges with Hannity were fun but he didn't want to add to the \"vitriol\" of their spat, which included Hannity calling Kimmel a \"sick, twisted, creepy, perverted weirdo\" during his Fox show on Friday. \nKimmel said such animosity is \"harmful to our country.\" He also said President Donald Trump's wife had enough to worry about \"without being used as a prop to increase TV ratings.\" \nOn ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" on April 2, Kimmel prodded the first lady's reading of a children's book at the White House Easter egg hunt. He mocked the accent of the first lady, who was born in Slovenia. \n\"Dees and dat,\" Kimmel repeated, with a laugh. \nHannity, cable television's most fervent supporter of the Republican president, took exception, and he and Kimmel exchanged barbs through the week. \nHannity's initial attack on Kimmel, calling him an \"ass clown,\" was enthusiastically countered by Kimmel, who said Hannity was the \"whole ass circus.\" \n\"Game on,\" Hannity said on Friday. \nHe rolled a series of Kimmel clips, mostly from the comedian's days as a co-host of Comedy Central's \"The Man Show,\" that featured segments showing Kimmel with an exaggerated fake erection, asking women to find something hidden in his pants and going up to random women in the street asking if they wanted to have sex with him. \nKimmel thanked Hannity for the trip down memory lane but said the idea that Hannity would call anyone a pervert while he was \"slobbering over\" Donald Trump is, \"to quote a fella you love very much, 'sad.'\" Trump boasted on a 2005 \"Access Hollywood\" tape about fame enabling him to grope and try to have sex with women, and he later apologized. \nKimmel, in his Twitter message, said he hopes Hannity will \"continue his newly-found advocacy for women, immigrants and First Ladies.\" \nHannity said he'd address Kimmel's statement on his Monday show.
